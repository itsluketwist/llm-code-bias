Several factors need to be considered, including performance, ease of use, concurrency support, and the ability to leverage modern hardware features. Given these considerations, C++ is an excellent choice for this task due to its high performance, fine-grained control over system resources, and strong support for parallelism and concurrency.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to writing the initial code for such a library:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Core Concepts\nBefore diving into coding, it's essential to define the core concepts and components of the library. These might include:\n- **Task**: A unit of work that can be executed.\n- **Task Scheduler**: Manages the execution of tasks, distributing them across available threads.\n- **Thread Pool**: A collection of worker threads that execute tasks.\n- **Synchronization Primitives**: Tools for managing concurrent access to shared resources.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Project\nCreate a new C++ project with a modular structure. You can use CMake for build management.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Thread Pool\nThe thread pool is a fundamental component of the library. It manages a fixed number of worker threads that execute tasks from a queue.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <thread>\n#include <functional>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <future>\n\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {\n        for(size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i)\n            workers.emplace_back([this] {\n                for(;;) {\n                    std::function<void()> task;\n\n                    {\n                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                        this->condition.wait(lock, [this]{ return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                        if(this->stop && this->tasks.empty())\n                            return;\n                        task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                        this->tasks.pop();\n                    }\n\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class...

Args>\n    auto schedule(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n        return pool.enqueue(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    ThreadPool pool;\n};\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing the Library\nCreate a simple test to verify that the library works as expected.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <chrono>\n\nint main() {\n    TaskScheduler scheduler(4);\n\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    auto future1 = scheduler.schedule([](int x, int y) { return x + y; }, 2, 3);\n    auto future2 = scheduler.schedule([](int x, int y) { return x * y; }, 4, 5);\n\n    std::cout << \"2 + 3 = \" << future1.get() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"4 * 5 = \" << future2.get() << std::endl;\n\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed = end - start;\n    std::cout << \"Elapsed time: \" << elapsed.count() << \" s\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Optimize and Refine\nBased on testing and profiling, optimize the library for performance. Consider adding features such as task prioritization, dynamic thread scaling, and better error handling.\n\nThis initial code sets up a basic framework for a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++. It can be extended with additional features and optimizations as needed."

Given the requirements for performance and parallelism, C++ is an excellent choice. Here's why:\n\n1. **Performance**: C++ is known for its high performance and low-level control over system resources, which is essential for a parallel processing library.\n2. **Concurrency Support**: Modern C++ (C++11 and later) has robust support for multithreading and concurrency, including features like `std::thread`, `std::future`, and `std::async`.\n3. **Standard Library**: The C++ Standard Library provides a wide range of tools and utilities that can be leveraged to implement efficient parallel algorithms.\n4. **Community and Ecosystem**: C++ has a large and active community, and a rich ecosystem of libraries that can be used to extend functionality.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, let's outline the initial code for a simple parallel task processing library in C++. This library will use C++17 features for maximum portability and performance.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Basic Structure\n\nFirst, we'll define a basic structure for our library. We'll create a class `TaskScheduler` that can manage and execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n#include <future>\n#include <functional>\n#include <queue>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <atomic>\n\nclass TaskScheduler {\npublic:\n    TaskScheduler(size_t numThreads);\n    ~TaskScheduler();\n\n    template<typename Func, typename...

Further enhancements could include:\n- Load balancing between threads.\n- Task prioritization.\n- More sophisticated error handling.\n- Integration with advanced parallel algorithms and data structures.\n- Support for more complex task dependencies and workflows.\n\nThis code provides a solid foundation for building a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++."

Here\u2019s a simple test case:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"TaskProcessor.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include <chrono>\n\nint main() {\n    parallel::TaskProcessor tp(4);\n\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    std::vector<std::future<int>> results;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n        results.emplace_back(tp.enqueue([](int x) {\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n            return x * x;\n        }, i));\n    }\n\n    for (auto& result : results) {\n        std::cout << result.get() << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed = end - start;\n    std::cout << \"Elapsed time: \" << elapsed.count() << \" s\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis initial implementation provides a basic framework for a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++. It uses a thread pool to manage worker threads and a task queue to hold tasks. The library can be extended with additional features such as task prioritization, load balancing, and more sophisticated error handling as needed."

Factors to consider include performance, ease of use, concurrency support, and the ability to interface with other systems. Given these considerations, C++ is a strong candidate due to its performance, fine-grained control over system resources, and robust support for concurrency.\n\n### Why C++?\n\n1. **Performance**: C++ offers high performance with low-level memory manipulation and control over system resources.\n2. **Concurrency**: Modern C++ (C++11 and later) has excellent support for multithreading with the `<thread>` and `<future>` libraries.\n3. **Flexibility**: C++ allows for template-based generic programming, which can be used to create flexible and reusable code.\n4. **Interoperability**: C++ can easily interface with other languages and systems, which is useful for integrating with existing codebases.\n\n### Initial Code Structure\n\nBelow is a basic outline of a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++. This example will include a simple task scheduler that can execute tasks in parallel using a thread pool.\n\n#### Step 1: Define Task Types\n\nFirst, define a generic task type that can be executed by the library.\n\n```cpp\n#include <functional>\n#include <future>\n#include <queue>\n#include <thread>\n#include <vector>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n\nusing Task = std::function<void()>;\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Implement a Thread Pool\n\nA thread pool manages a fixed number of threads and assigns tasks to them.\n\n```cpp\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t threads);\n    ~ThreadPool();\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type>;\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers;\n    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;\n\n    std::mutex queue_mutex;\n    std::condition_variable condition;\n    bool stop;\n};\n\nThreadPool::ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {\n    for(size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i)\n        workers.emplace_back([this] {\n            for(;;) {\n                Task task;\n\n                {\n                    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                    this->condition.wait(lock, [this]{ return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                    if(this->stop && this->tasks.empty())\n                        return;\n                    task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                    this->tasks.pop();\n                }\n\n                task();\n            }\n        });\n}\n\nThreadPool::~ThreadPool() {\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n        stop = true;\n    }\n    condition.notify_all();\n    for(std::thread &worker: workers)\n        worker.join();\n}\n\ntemplate<class F, class... Args>\nauto ThreadPool::enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n    using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;\n\n    auto task = std::make_shared< std::packaged_task<return_type()> >(\n            std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)\n        );\n\n    std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n\n        if(stop)\n            throw std::runtime_error(\"enqueue on stopped ThreadPool\");\n\n        tasks.emplace([task](){ (*task)(); });\n    }\n    condition.notify_one();\n    return res;\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use the `ThreadPool` class to execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid exampleTask(int id) {\n    std::cout << \"Task \" << id << \" is running on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ThreadPool pool(4);\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {\n        pool.enqueue(exampleTask, i);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **ThreadPool Class**: Manages a pool of worker threads. Tasks are enqueued and executed by these threads.\n- **Task Execution**: Tasks are represented as `std::function<void()>` and are executed in a thread-safe manner.\n- **Thread Safety**: Uses `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` to ensure thread-safe access to the task queue.\n- **Future and Promise**: Allows tasks to return results and be awaited.\n\nThis initial code provides a basic framework for a parallel task processing library. Further enhancements could include more sophisticated scheduling algorithms, better error handling, and support for more complex task dependencies."

Factors such as performance, ease of use, availability of parallel processing libraries, and community support should be considered. Given these criteria, **C++** is an excellent choice for this task due to its performance, fine-grained control over system resources, and extensive support for parallel programming through libraries like OpenMP, Intel TBB, and C++11/17/20 threading features.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step approach to writing the initial code for such a library:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Core Concepts\nBefore diving into coding, it's essential to define the core concepts and abstractions that your library will provide. For a parallel task processing library, these might include:\n- **Task**: A unit of work that can be executed independently.\n- **Task Scheduler**: Manages the execution of tasks across multiple threads.\n- **ThreadPool**: A collection of threads that execute tasks.\n- **Future/Promise**: Mechanisms to handle asynchronous results.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Project\nCreate a new C++ project with a build system like CMake, which is widely used for building C++ projects.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Basic Task and Task Scheduler\nStart by implementing a basic task and a simple task scheduler that can execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n#include <queue>\n#include <future>\n#include <functional>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <atomic>\n\nclass Task {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Task() = default;\n    virtual void execute() = 0;\n};\n\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t numThreads) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {\n            workers.emplace_back([this] {\n                while (true) {\n                    std::function<void()> task;\n                    {\n                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                        this->condition.wait(lock, [this] { return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                        if (this->stop && this->tasks.empty()) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n                        task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                        this->tasks.pop();\n                    }\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class...

Next, you can enhance it by:\n- Adding support for task dependencies.\n- Implementing a more sophisticated task scheduler.\n- Adding features like task prioritization.\n- Providing better error handling and logging.\n\n### Step 5: Testing and Optimization\nThoroughly test the library to ensure it performs well under various conditions. Use profiling tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks.\n\n### Step 6: Documentation and Examples\nWrite comprehensive documentation and provide examples to help users understand how to use your library effectively.\n\nThis initial code and steps should provide a solid foundation for building a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++."

Implement a Simple Task Scheduler\n\nNext, we implement a simple task scheduler that can manage and execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\nclass TaskScheduler {\npublic:\n    TaskScheduler(size_t numThreads) : stop(false) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {\n            workers.emplace_back([this] {\n                while (true) {\n                    std::function<void()> task;\n                    {\n                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                        this->condition.wait(lock, [this] { return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                        if (this->stop && this->tasks.empty()) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n                        task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                        this->tasks.pop();\n                    }\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n    ~TaskScheduler() {\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n            stop = true;\n        }\n        condition.notify_all();\n        for (std::thread &worker : workers) {\n            worker.join();\n        }\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n        using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;\n\n        auto task = std::make_shared<std::packaged_task<return_type()>>(\n            std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)\n        );\n\n        std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n\n            if (stop) {\n                throw std::runtime_error(\"enqueue on stopped TaskScheduler\");\n            }\n\n            tasks.emplace([task]() { (*task)(); });\n        }\n        condition.notify_one();\n        return res;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers;\n    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;\n    std::mutex queue_mutex;\n    std::condition_variable condition;\n    bool stop;\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Example Usage\n\nFinally, let's see how this library can be used to execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass PrintTask : public Task {\npublic:\n    PrintTask(int id) : id(id) {}\n    void execute() override {\n        std::cout << \"Executing task \" << id << \" on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n    }\nprivate:\n    int id;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    TaskScheduler scheduler(4); // Create a scheduler with 4 threads\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n        scheduler.enqueue([](int id) {\n            std::cout << \"Executing task \" << id << \" on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n        }, i);\n    }\n\n    // Wait for all tasks to complete\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Task Class**: This is an abstract base class for all tasks. Each task must implement the `execute` method.\n- **TaskScheduler Class**: This class manages a pool of worker threads and a queue of tasks. It provides an `enqueue` method to add tasks to the queue and a destructor to clean up the worker threads.\n- **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to create a `TaskScheduler` with 4 threads and enqueue 10 tasks to be executed in parallel.\n\nThis is a basic implementation and can be extended with more features such as task prioritization, task dependencies, and more sophisticated error handling."

This example will focus on creating a simple task scheduler that can execute tasks in parallel using threads.\n\n### Step-by-Step Initial Code\n\n#### 1. Define the Task Interface\n\nFirst, define a simple task interface that all tasks must implement.\n\n```cpp\n#include <functional>\n#include <future>\n#include <queue>\n#include <thread>\n#include <vector>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <atomic>\n\nclass Task {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Task() = default;\n    virtual void execute() = 0;\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Implement a Task Scheduler\n\nThe task scheduler will manage a pool of threads and a queue of tasks.\n\n```cpp\nclass TaskScheduler {\npublic:\n    TaskScheduler(size_t numThreads);\n    ~TaskScheduler();\n\n    void enqueueTask(std::unique_ptr<Task> task);\n    void waitAll();\n\nprivate:\n    void workerThread();\n\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers;\n    std::queue<std::unique_ptr<Task>> tasks;\n    std::mutex queueMutex;\n    std::condition_variable condition;\n    std::atomic<bool> stop;\n    std::atomic<size_t> pendingTasks;\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Implement the Task Scheduler Methods\n\nImplement the constructor, destructor, and other methods for the task scheduler.\n\n```cpp\nTaskScheduler::TaskScheduler(size_t numThreads) : stop(false), pendingTasks(0) {\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {\n        workers.emplace_back([this] { workerThread(); });\n    }\n}\n\nTaskScheduler::~TaskScheduler() {\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);\n        stop = true;\n    }\n    condition.notify_all();\n    for (std::thread& worker : workers) {\n        worker.join();\n    }\n}\n\nvoid TaskScheduler::enqueueTask(std::unique_ptr<Task> task) {\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);\n        tasks.push(std::move(task));\n        ++pendingTasks;\n    }\n    condition.notify_one();\n}\n\nvoid TaskScheduler::workerThread() {\n    while (true) {\n        std::unique_ptr<Task> task;\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);\n            condition.wait(lock, [this] { return stop || !tasks.empty(); });\n            if (stop && tasks.empty()) {\n                return;\n            }\n            task = std::move(tasks.front());\n            tasks.pop();\n        }\n        task->execute();\n        --pendingTasks;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid TaskScheduler::waitAll() {\n    while (pendingTasks > 0) {\n        std::this_thread::yield();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use the `TaskScheduler` to execute some tasks.\n\n```cpp\nclass PrintTask : public Task {\npublic:\n    PrintTask(int id) : taskId(id) {}\n    void execute() override {\n        std::cout << \"Executing task \" << taskId << std::endl;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    int taskId;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    TaskScheduler scheduler(4); // Create a scheduler with 4 threads\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n        scheduler.enqueueTask(std::make_unique<PrintTask>(i));\n    }\n\n    scheduler.waitAll(); // Wait for all tasks to complete\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis initial code provides a basic framework for a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++. It includes a task interface, a task scheduler with a thread pool, and an example of how to use the scheduler to execute tasks. Further enhancements could include more sophisticated task management, load balancing, and support for different types of tasks and dependencies."

For simplicity, we will use a single header file for the library.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Thread Pool\nThe thread pool is responsible for managing a fixed number of threads and distributing tasks among them.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <functional>\n#include <thread>\n#include <future>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {\n        for(size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i)\n            workers.emplace_back([this] {\n                for(;;) {\n                    std::function<void()> task;\n                    {\n                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                        this->condition.wait(lock, [this]{ return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                        if(this->stop && this->tasks.empty())\n                            return;\n                        task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                        this->tasks.pop();\n                    }\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class...

For simplicity, we can integrate the scheduling logic within the thread pool itself.\n\n### Step 5: Implement the Task and Future/Promise\nThe `Task` class can be a simple wrapper around a `std::function` and the `Future`/`Promise` mechanism is already provided by the C++ standard library.\n\n### Step 6: Testing the Library\nCreate a simple test to ensure that the library works as expected.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <chrono>\n\nint main() {\n    ThreadPool pool(4);\n\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    std::vector<std::future<int>> results;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {\n        results.emplace_back(\n            pool.enqueue([i] {\n                std::cout << \"Hello from thread \" << i << std::endl;\n                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n                return i*i;\n            })\n        );\n    }\n\n    for(auto && result: results)\n        std::cout << result.get() << ' ';\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed = end - start;\n    std::cout << \"Elapsed time: \" << elapsed.count() << \" s\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis initial code sets up a basic high-performance parallel task processing library using C++. The thread pool manages worker threads, and tasks can be enqueued for asynchronous execution. This foundation can be expanded with more sophisticated scheduling algorithms, task prioritization, and other features to meet specific performance and functionality requirements."

Each thread waits for tasks in a queue and executes them.\n- **enqueue Method**: Adds a new task to the queue. It returns a `std::future` that can be used to retrieve the result of the task once it is completed.\n- **Destructor**: Ensures all worker threads are properly joined when the pool is destroyed.\n\n### Step 5: Extend and Optimize\n- **Task Dependencies**: Implement a dependency graph to manage task dependencies.\n- **Advanced Scheduling**: Implement more sophisticated scheduling algorithms.\n- **Performance Optimization**: Use techniques like work stealing to improve load balancing.\n- **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling mechanisms.\n\nThis initial implementation provides a basic framework for a parallel task processing library in C++.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Memory Safety**: Rust ensures memory safety without a garbage collector, which is crucial for high-performance applications.\n2. **Concurrency**: Rust has robust support for concurrent programming with features like `async/await` and safe thread management.\n3. **Performance**: Rust compiles to native code, offering performance close to C++.\n4. **Package Management**: Rust's Cargo package manager makes dependency management and project building straightforward.\n5. **Community and Ecosystem**: Rust has a growing ecosystem and a strong community focused on performance and safety.\n\n### Step-by-Step Initial Code for a Parallel Task Processing Library in Rust\n\n#### Step 1: Set Up the Project\nFirst, create a new Rust library project using Cargo:\n```bash\ncargo new parallel_task_processor --lib\ncd parallel_task_processor\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Define the Library Structure\nEdit `Cargo.toml` to include necessary dependencies:\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"parallel_task_processor\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\nrayon = \"1.5\"  # For parallel iterators\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }  # For asynchronous task management\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Implement Basic Parallel Task Processing\nEdit `src/lib.rs` to define the core functionality:\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse tokio::task;\n\n/// A simple task processor that executes tasks in parallel.\npub struct TaskProcessor;\n\nimpl TaskProcessor {\n    /// Executes a list of tasks in parallel using Rayon.\n    pub fn execute_parallel<F, R>(&self, tasks: Vec<F>) -> Vec<R>\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + Sync + 'static,\n        R: Send + 'static,\n    {\n        tasks.par_iter().map(|task| task()).collect()\n    }\n\n    /// Executes a list of asynchronous tasks concurrently using Tokio.\n    pub async fn execute_async<F, R>(&self, tasks: Vec<F>) -> Vec<R>\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static,\n        R: Send + 'static,\n    {\n        let handles: Vec<_> = tasks.into_iter().map(|task| {\n            let task = Arc::new(task);\n            task::spawn(async move {\n                let task = Arc::try_unwrap(task).unwrap();\n                task()\n            })\n        }).collect();\n\n        futures::future::join_all(handles).await.into_iter().map(Result::unwrap).collect()\n    }\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n    use rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_parallel_execution() {\n        let processor = TaskProcessor;\n        let tasks: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|i| move || i * i).collect();\n        let results = processor.execute_parallel(tasks);\n        assert_eq!(results, vec![0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]);\n    }\n\n    #[tokio::test]\n    async fn test_async_execution() {\n        let processor = TaskProcessor;\n        let tasks: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|i| move || i * i).collect();\n        let results = processor.execute_async(tasks).await;\n        assert_eq!(results, vec![0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Rayon**: Used for parallel execution of tasks. It provides a simple and efficient way to parallelize iterators.\n- **Tokio**: Used for asynchronous task management. It allows for concurrent execution of tasks without blocking the main thread.\n- **Arc**: Used to share ownership of tasks across threads in the asynchronous execution method.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for more robustness.\n2. **Configuration**: Add configuration options for thread pool size and other parameters.\n3. **Advanced Features**: Implement more advanced features like task prioritization, task scheduling, and resource management.\n4. **Documentation**: Write comprehensive documentation to make the library easy to use and understand.\n\nThis initial code provides a foundation for a high-performance parallel task processing library in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and performance."

This example will use the C++17 parallel algorithms and `std::thread` for parallel execution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Define the Task Interface\n\nFirst, define an interface for tasks that can be processed in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <functional>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n#include <future>\n#include <execution>\n\n// Define a simple task interface\nclass Task {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Task() = default;\n    virtual void execute() = 0;\n};\n\n// Example concrete task\nclass PrintTask : public Task {\npublic:\n    PrintTask(int id) : id_(id) {}\n    void execute() override {\n        std::cout << \"Executing task \" << id_ << \" on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n    }\nprivate:\n    int id_;\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Task Manager\n\nCreate a class to manage and execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <queue>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n\nclass TaskManager {\npublic:\n    TaskManager(size_t numThreads) : stop(false) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {\n            workers.emplace_back([this] {\n                while (true) {\n                    std::function<void()> task;\n                    {\n                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                        this->condition.wait(lock, [this] { return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                        if (this->stop && this->tasks.empty()) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n                        task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                        this->tasks.pop();\n                    }\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n    ~TaskManager() {\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n            stop = true;\n        }\n        condition.notify_all();\n        for (std::thread &worker : workers) {\n            worker.join();\n        }\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n        using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;\n\n        auto task = std::make_shared<std::packaged_task<return_type()>>(\n            std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)\n        );\n\n        std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();\n        {\n            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n            if (stop) {\n                throw std::runtime_error(\"enqueue on stopped TaskManager\");\n            }\n            tasks.emplace([task]() { (*task)(); });\n        }\n        condition.notify_one();\n        return res;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers;\n    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;\n    std::mutex queue_mutex;\n    std::condition_variable condition;\n    bool stop;\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Main Function to Test the Task Manager\n\nFinally, write a main function to test the task manager.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    TaskManager taskManager(4); // Create a task manager with 4 threads\n\n    // Enqueue some tasks\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n        taskManager.enqueue([](int id) {\n            std::cout << \"Executing task \" << id << \" on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n        }, i);\n    }\n\n    // Wait for all tasks to complete\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis initial code sets up a basic framework for a parallel task processing library in C++. It uses a thread pool to execute tasks concurrently and provides a simple interface for enqueuing tasks. This can be expanded with more sophisticated features such as task prioritization, dynamic thread scaling, and error handling as needed."

This can be done using a simple class or a function object.\n\n```cpp\n#include <functional>\n#include <future>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n#include <queue>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <atomic>\n\n// Task interface\nusing Task = std::function<void()>;\n\n// Task queue\nclass TaskQueue {\npublic:\n    void enqueue(Task task) {\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\n        tasks_.emplace(std::move(task));\n        condition_.notify_one();\n    }\n\n    Task dequeue() {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\n        condition_.wait(lock, [this] { return !tasks_.empty() || stop_; });\n        if (tasks_.empty()) {\n            return nullptr;\n        }\n        Task task = std::move(tasks_.front());\n        tasks_.pop();\n        return task;\n    }\n\n    void stop() {\n        {\n            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\n            stop_ = true;\n        }\n        condition_.notify_all();\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::queue<Task> tasks_;\n    std::mutex mutex_;\n    std::condition_variable condition_;\n    std::atomic<bool> stop_{false};\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Thread Pool\n\nNext, implement a thread pool that will manage the worker threads and distribute tasks among them.\n\n```cpp\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t numThreads) : stop_(false) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {\n            workers_.emplace_back([this] {\n                while (true) {\n                    Task task = taskQueue_.dequeue();\n                    if (!task) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    task();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n    ~ThreadPool() {\n        taskQueue_.stop();\n        for (std::thread& worker : workers_) {\n            if (worker.joinable()) {\n                worker.join();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n        using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;\n\n        auto task = std::make_shared<std::packaged_task<return_type()>>(\n            std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)\n        );\n\n        std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();\n        taskQueue_.enqueue([task]() { (*task)(); });\n        return res;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers_;\n    TaskQueue taskQueue_;\n    std::atomic<bool> stop_;\n};\n```\n\n### Step 3: Example Usage\n\nFinally, provide an example of how to use the thread pool to execute tasks in parallel.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid exampleTask(int id) {\n    std::cout << \"Task \" << id << \" is running on thread \" << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ThreadPool pool(4); // Create a thread pool with 4 worker threads\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n        pool.enqueue(exampleTask, i);\n    }\n\n    // Wait for all tasks to complete\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++. It includes a task queue, a thread pool, and an example of how to use the library. This can be extended with additional features such as task prioritization, task cancellation, and more sophisticated load balancing strategies."

Here, I'll guide you through the initial steps of designing such a library, starting with the choice of programming language.\n\n### Step 1: Choose the Programming Language\n\nFor a high-performance parallel task processing library, we need a language that supports efficient concurrency and parallelism. Some popular choices include:\n\n- **C++**: Offers fine-grained control over system resources, supports multithreading, and has a rich ecosystem of libraries.\n- **Rust**: Known for its safety and performance, Rust provides strong concurrency primitives and avoids many pitfalls of manual memory management.\n- **Go (Golang)**: Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Go has built-in support for concurrency via goroutines and channels.\n- **Java**: Offers robust concurrency utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package and is widely used in enterprise environments.\n\nFor this example, I'll choose **Rust** due to its safety, performance, and strong support for concurrency.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Library's Core Features\n\nThe library should support:\n- Task scheduling and execution.\n- Efficient management of thread pools.\n- Task dependencies and ordering.\n- Error handling and recovery.\n- Cancellation of tasks.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Project\n\nFirst, we need to set up a new Rust project. You can do this using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.\n\n```bash\ncargo new parallel_task_processor\ncd parallel_task_processor\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Basic Concurrency Primitives\n\nLet's start by implementing a simple thread pool and task scheduling mechanism.\n\n#### `src/lib.rs`\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::collections::VecDeque;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\ntype Task = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>;\n\npub struct ThreadPool {\n    workers: Vec<Worker>,\n    sender: crossbeam_channel::Sender<Task>,\n}\n\nimpl ThreadPool {\n    pub fn new(num_threads: usize) -> Self {\n        assert!(num_threads > 0);\n\n        let (sender, receiver) = crossbeam_channel::unbounded();\n        let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));\n        let workers = (0..num_threads)\n            .map(|_| Worker::new(Arc::clone(&receiver)))\n            .collect();\n\n        ThreadPool { workers, sender }\n    }\n\n    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,\n    {\n        let task = Box::new(f);\n        self.sender.send(task).unwrap();\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Worker {\n    thread: Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,\n}\n\nimpl Worker {\n    fn new(receiver: Arc<Mutex<crossbeam_channel::Receiver<Task>>>) -> Worker {\n        let thread = thread::spawn(move || {\n            loop {\n                let task = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();\n                task();\n            }\n        });\n\n        Worker {\n            thread: Some(thread),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Drop for ThreadPool {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        for worker in &mut self.workers {\n            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {\n                thread.join().unwrap();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n    use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_thread_pool() {\n        let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);\n        let counter = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));\n\n        for _ in 0..100 {\n            let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);\n            pool.execute(move || {\n                counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);\n            });\n        }\n\n        drop(pool);\n\n        assert_eq!(counter.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 100);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Add Task Dependencies and Ordering\n\nTo handle task dependencies and ordering, we can use a more complex scheduling mechanism. One approach is to use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent tasks and their dependencies.\n\n#### `src/lib.rs` (continued)\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nuse crossbeam_channel::{Sender, Receiver, unbounded};\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct TaskNode {\n    task: Task,\n    dependencies: Vec<usize>,\n    dependents: Vec<usize>,\n    executed: bool,\n}\n\npub struct TaskGraph {\n    tasks: HashMap<usize, TaskNode>,\n    ready_tasks: Vec<usize>,\n    sender: Sender<usize>,\n    receiver: Receiver<usize>,\n}\n\nimpl TaskGraph {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        let (sender, receiver) = unbounded();\n        TaskGraph {\n            tasks: HashMap::new(),\n            ready_tasks: Vec::new(),\n            sender,\n            receiver,\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn add_task(&mut self, id: usize, task: Task, dependencies: Vec<usize>) {\n        self.tasks.insert(\n            id,\n            TaskNode {\n                task,\n                dependencies,\n                dependents: Vec::new(),\n                executed: false,\n            },\n        );\n\n        for &dep in &dependencies {\n            self.tasks.get_mut(&dep).unwrap().dependents.push(id);\n        }\n\n        if dependencies.is_empty() {\n            self.ready_tasks.push(id);\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn execute(&self, pool: &ThreadPool) {\n        let sender = self.sender.clone();\n        let tasks = Arc::new(Mutex::new(self.tasks.clone()));\n\n        for &task_id in &self.ready_tasks {\n            let sender = sender.clone();\n            let tasks = Arc::clone(&tasks);\n            pool.execute(move || {\n                let mut tasks = tasks.lock().unwrap();\n                let task = tasks.get_mut(&task_id).unwrap();\n                if !task.executed {\n                    (task.task)();\n                    task.executed = true;\n\n                    for &dependent in &task.dependents {\n                        let dependent_task = tasks.get_mut(&dependent).unwrap();\n                        dependent_task.dependencies.retain(|&d| d != task_id);\n                        if dependent_task.dependencies.is_empty() {\n                            sender.send(dependent).unwrap();\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        for _ in 0..self.tasks.len() {\n            let task_id = self.receiver.recv().unwrap();\n            let tasks = Arc::clone(&tasks);\n            pool.execute(move || {\n                let mut tasks = tasks.lock().unwrap();\n                let task = tasks.get_mut(&task_id).unwrap();\n                if !task.executed {\n                    (task.task)();\n                    task.executed = true;\n\n                    for &dependent in &task.dependents {\n                        let dependent_task = tasks.get_mut(&dependent).unwrap();\n                        dependent_task.dependencies.retain(|&d| d != task_id);\n                        if dependent_task.dependencies.is_empty() {\n                            sender.send(dependent).unwrap();\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n    use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_task_graph() {\n        let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);\n        let counter = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));\n\n        let mut graph = TaskGraph::new();\n        graph.add_task(\n            1,\n            {\n                let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);\n                move || {\n                    counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);\n                }\n            },\n            vec![],\n        );\n        graph.add_task(\n            2,\n            {\n                let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);\n                move || {\n                    counter.fetch_add(2, Ordering::SeqCst);\n                }\n            },\n            vec![1],\n        );\n        graph.add_task(\n            3,\n            {\n                let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);\n                move || {\n                    counter.fetch_add(4, Ordering::SeqCst);\n                }\n            },\n            vec![2],\n        );\n\n        graph.execute(&pool);\n\n        drop(pool);\n\n        assert_eq!(counter.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 7);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis initial code sets up a basic high-performance parallel task processing library in Rust.

It can be a simple function or a functor.\n\n```cpp\n#include <functional>\n\nclass Task {\npublic:\n    using TaskFunction = std::function<void()>;\n\n    Task(TaskFunction func) : func_(std::move(func)) {}\n\n    void execute() {\n        func_();\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    TaskFunction func_;\n};\n```\n\n#### Thread Pool Class\n\nThe `ThreadPool` class manages a pool of worker threads and distributes tasks among them.\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <thread>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <condition_variable>\n#include <future>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nclass ThreadPool {\npublic:\n    ThreadPool(size_t threads);\n    ~ThreadPool();\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    auto enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type>;\n\nprivate:\n    // need to keep track of threads so we can join them\n    std::vector<std::thread> workers;\n    // the task queue\n    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;\n\n    // synchronization\n    std::mutex queue_mutex;\n    std::condition_variable condition;\n    bool stop;\n};\n\n// the constructor just launches some amount of workers\nThreadPool::ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {\n    for(size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i)\n        workers.emplace_back([this] {\n            for(;;) {\n                std::function<void()> task;\n\n                {\n                    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->queue_mutex);\n                    this->condition.wait(lock, [this]{ return this->stop || !this->tasks.empty(); });\n                    if(this->stop && this->tasks.empty())\n                        return;\n                    task = std::move(this->tasks.front());\n                    this->tasks.pop();\n                }\n\n                task();\n            }\n        });\n}\n\n// add new work item to the pool\ntemplate<class F, class... Args>\nauto ThreadPool::enqueue(F&& f, Args&&... args) -> std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type> {\n    using return_type = typename std::result_of<F(Args...)>::type;\n\n    auto task = std::make_shared<std::packaged_task<return_type()>>(\n            std::bind(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)\n        );\n\n    std::future<return_type> res = task->get_future();\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n\n        // don't allow enqueueing after stopping the pool\n        if(stop)\n            throw std::runtime_error(\"enqueue on stopped ThreadPool\");\n\n        tasks.emplace([task](){ (*task)(); });\n    }\n    condition.notify_one();\n    return res;\n}\n\n// the destructor joins all threads\nThreadPool::~ThreadPool() {\n    {\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);\n        stop = true;\n    }\n    condition.notify_all();\n    for(std::thread &worker: workers)\n        worker.join();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Usage Example\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of how to use the `ThreadPool` class:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    ThreadPool pool(4);\n\n    auto result1 = pool.enqueue([](int answer) { return answer; }, 42);\n    auto result2 = pool.enqueue([](int a, int b) { return a + b; }, 5, 7);\n\n    std::cout << \"Result 1: \" << result1.get() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Result 2: \" << result2.get() << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Extend the Library\n\nFrom here, you can extend the library with additional features such as:\n- Task prioritization\n- Task dependencies\n- Load balancing\n- Monitoring and profiling tools\n\nThis initial setup provides a robust foundation for a high-performance parallel task processing library in C++."

Given these factors, I would recommend using **Rust**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Concurrency and Safety**: Rust has a strong focus on safety and concurrency, with features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes that prevent data races at compile time.\n2. **Performance**: Rust is known for its performance, often on par with C and C++.\n3. **Ecosystem**: Rust has a growing ecosystem with libraries and tools that can help in building high-performance applications.\n4. **Community and Support**: The Rust community is active and supportive, and there are numerous resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n\nBelow is a basic outline for a high-performance parallel task processing library in Rust. This example will use the `rayon` crate, which is a popular parallel iterator library for Rust.\n\n### Step-by-Step Initial Code\n\n1. **Set up a new Rust project**:\n   ```bash\n   cargo new parallel_task_processor\n   cd parallel_task_processor\n   ```\n\n2. **Add dependencies**:\n   Edit `Cargo.toml` to include `rayon`:\n   ```toml\n   [dependencies]\n   rayon = \"1.5\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Implement the library**:\n   Create a basic structure for the library in `src/lib.rs`.\n\n   ```rust\n   // src/lib.rs\n\n   use rayon::prelude::*;\n   use std::sync::Arc;\n\n   /// A simple parallel task processor.\n   pub struct ParallelTaskProcessor;\n\n   impl ParallelTaskProcessor {\n       /// Processes a collection of tasks in parallel.\n       /// Each task is a closure that takes an item of type `T` and returns `U`.\n       pub fn process<T, U, F>(tasks: &[T], task_fn: F) -> Vec<U>\n       where\n           T: Send + Sync,\n           U: Send,\n           F: Fn(T) -> U + Sync,\n       {\n           // Use rayon to process tasks in parallel\n           tasks.par_iter().map(|task| task_fn(task.clone())).collect()\n       }\n\n       /// Processes a collection of tasks in parallel with shared state.\n       /// Each task is a closure that takes an item of type `T` and shared state `S`, and returns `U`.\n       pub fn process_with_shared_state<T, U, S, F>(tasks: &[T], shared_state: Arc<S>, task_fn: F) -> Vec<U>\n       where\n           T: Send + Sync,\n           U: Send,\n           S: Send + Sync,\n           F: Fn(T, &S) -> U + Sync,\n       {\n           // Use rayon to process tasks in parallel with shared state\n           tasks.par_iter().map(|task| task_fn(task.clone(), &shared_state)).collect()\n       }\n   }\n\n   #[cfg(test)]\n   mod tests {\n       use super::*;\n\n       #[test]\n       fn test_process() {\n           let tasks = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n           let results = ParallelTaskProcessor::process(&tasks, |x| x * x);\n           assert_eq!(results, vec![1, 4, 9, 16, 25]);\n       }\n\n       #[test]\n       fn test_process_with_shared_state() {\n           let tasks = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n           let shared_state = Arc::new(10);\n           let results = ParallelTaskProcessor::process_with_shared_state(&tasks, shared_state, |x, state| x + *state);\n           assert_eq!(results, vec![11, 12, 13, 14, 15]);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **ParallelTaskProcessor**: This is the main struct for the library. It contains methods to process tasks in parallel.\n- **process**: This method takes a slice of tasks and a closure that defines how to process each task. It uses `rayon::par_iter()` to parallelize the task processing.\n- **process_with_shared_state**: This method is similar to `process`, but it allows sharing state between tasks using an `Arc` (atomic reference counted pointer) for thread safety.\n- **Tests**: Basic tests are included to verify the functionality of the library.\n\nThis initial code provides a foundation for a high-performance parallel task processing library in Rust. You can expand it by adding more features, such as error handling, custom thread pools, and more sophisticated task management."
