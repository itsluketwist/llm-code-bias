It uses C++ and provides a powerful set of tools for building complex GUI applications.\n\nGiven this list, let's choose a language and framework. For this example, I'll use **C# with .NET MAUI** due to its powerful features, strong community support, and the ability to build native applications for multiple platforms efficiently.\n\n### Initial Code for a .NET MAUI Application\n\nFirst, ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from the [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).\n\nNow, create a new .NET MAUI application using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndotnet new maui -n MyCrossPlatformApp\ncd MyCrossPlatformApp\n```\n\nThis command creates a new .NET MAUI project named `MyCrossPlatformApp`. Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.\n\nHere's a simple example of the `MainPage.xaml` file, which defines the user interface:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<ContentPage xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui\"\n             xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\"\n             x:Class=\"MyCrossPlatformApp.MainPage\"\n             Title=\"Welcome to .NET MAUI\">\n\n    <StackLayout VerticalOptions=\"Center\" HorizontalOptions=\"Center\">\n        <Label Text=\"Hello, .NET MAUI!\"\n               FontSize=\"24\"\n               HorizontalOptions=\"Center\" />\n        <Button Text=\"Click Me\"\n                Clicked=\"OnButtonClicked\"\n                HorizontalOptions=\"Center\" />\n    </StackLayout>\n</ContentPage>\n```\n\nAnd here's the corresponding `MainPage.xaml.cs` file, which contains the code-behind logic:\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.Maui.Controls;\n\nnamespace MyCrossPlatformApp;\n\npublic partial class MainPage : ContentPage\n{\n    public MainPage()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    private void OnButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        DisplayAlert(\"Alert\", \"You clicked the button!\", \"OK\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis simple application displays a label and a button. When the button is clicked, it shows an alert dialog.\n\nTo run the application, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ndotnet build\ndotnet run\n```\n\nThis will build and run the application on your default platform. You can also specify the target platform using the `-f` (framework) and `-t` (target) options.\n\nThis setup provides a solid foundation for developing a modern cross-platform application with a graphical user interface using .NET MAUI."

You can download it from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).\n\nHere is a simple Flutter application that displays a \"Hello, World!\" message:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n  MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);\n\n  final String title;\n\n  @override\n  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n}\n\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n  int _counter = 0;\n\n  void _incrementCounter() {\n    setState(() {\n      _counter++;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(widget.title),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Text(\n              'You have pushed the button this many times:',\n            ),\n            Text(\n              '$_counter',\n              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n        tooltip: 'Increment',\n        child: Icon(Icons.add),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main` function**: The entry point of the application. It calls `runApp` with `MyApp` as its argument, which inflates the widget and attaches it to the screen.\n- **`MyApp` class**: A stateless widget that builds the root of the application. It returns a `MaterialApp`, which is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for material design applications.\n- **`MyHomePage` class**: A stateful widget that manages the state of the counter. It rebuilds its UI when the state changes.\n- **`_incrementCounter` method**: This method increments the counter and calls `setState` to trigger a rebuild of the widget tree.\n- **`Scaffold` widget**: Provides a default app bar, a title, and a floating action button.\n- **`Column` widget**: A layout widget that arranges its children in a vertical array.\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the basics of creating a Flutter application. Flutter\u2019s hot reload feature allows you to quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs."

Kivy is particularly good for applications with complex user interfaces, while BeeWare is more focused on native application development.\n\nGiven this list, let's choose **Dart with Flutter** for the initial code of our cross-platform application. Flutter is widely adopted for its performance, rich set of widgets, and the ability to create beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.\n\nHere is a simple example of a Flutter application that displays a \"Hello, World!\" message:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Hello World App'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(\n          'Hello, World!',\n          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **main()**: The entry point of the application. It calls `runApp()` with `MyApp()` as the argument.\n- **MyApp**: A stateless widget that builds the root of the application. It returns a `MaterialApp` widget, which is a convenience widget that wraps several widgets commonly required for material design applications.\n- **MyHomePage**: Another stateless widget that builds the home page of the application. It returns a `Scaffold` widget, which provides a default app bar and a body that contains a `Center` widget with a `Text` widget displaying \"Hello, World!\".\n\nThis code sets up a basic Flutter application that you can run on various platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop."

Flutter is a popular choice for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It offers a rich set of pre-designed widgets and a fast development cycle.\n\n#### Initial Code Example with Flutter (Dart)\n\nTo get started, you need to have Flutter installed on your system. Once Flutter is set up, you can create a new Flutter project using the command line:\n\n```bash\nflutter create my_cross_platform_app\ncd my_cross_platform_app\n```\n\nHere is a simple example of a Flutter application that displays \"Hello, World!\" on the screen:\n\n```dart\n// main.dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Hello World App'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  final String title;\n\n  MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(title),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(\n          'Hello, World!',\n          style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main.dart`**: This is the entry point of the Flutter application. The `main` function calls `runApp`, which inflates the widget tree and attaches it to the screen.\n- **`MyApp`**: A `StatelessWidget` that defines the application's theme and the home screen.\n- **`MyHomePage`**: Another `StatelessWidget` that represents the home screen of the application. It includes an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget containing a `Text` widget that displays \"Hello, World!\".\n\nThis example demonstrates the simplicity and power of Flutter for creating cross-platform applications. You can run this app on Android, iOS, web, and desktop with minimal changes."

It provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and a fast development cycle, making it an excellent choice for building modern GUI applications.\n\n### Initial Code for a Flutter Application\n\nBelow is a simple \"Hello, World!\" example for a Flutter application:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  final String title;\n\n  MyHomePage({required this.title});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(title),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Text(\n              'Hello, World!',\n              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main()`**: The entry point of the application, where `runApp()` is called to inflate the widget tree.\n- **`MyApp`**: A `StatelessWidget` that defines the root of the widget tree. It sets up the `MaterialApp` widget, which is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for material design applications.\n- **`MyHomePage`**: Another `StatelessWidget` that represents the home screen of the application. It displays a `Scaffold` widget, which provides a default app bar and a body that contains a `Center` widget with a `Column` that has a `Text` widget displaying \"Hello, World!\".\n\nThis example provides a basic structure to get started with a Flutter application. You can expand upon this by adding more widgets, state management, and functionality as needed."

Flutter is known for its fast development cycle, rich set of pre-built widgets, and the ability to create high-fidelity, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.\n\nHere's a simple initial setup for a Flutter application:\n\n### Step 1: Install Flutter SDK\n- Download and install Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).\n- Follow the instructions to set up your development environment.\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project\nOpen a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new Flutter project:\n\n```bash\nflutter create my_cross_platform_app\n```\n\n### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory\n```bash\ncd my_cross_platform_app\n```\n\n### Step 4: Open the Project in Your IDE\nYou can open the project in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA.\n\n### Step 5: Run the Application\nTo run the application on your preferred platform, use the following commands:\n\n- For Android:\n  ```bash\n  flutter run -d android\n  ```\n\n- For iOS (make sure you have Xcode installed and configured):\n  ```bash\n  flutter run -d ios\n  ```\n\n- For Web:\n  ```bash\n  flutter run -d chrome\n  ```\n\n- For Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux):\n  ```bash\n  flutter run -d macos\n  flutter run -d windows\n  flutter run -d linux\n  ```\n\n### Step 6: Modify the `main.dart` File\nOpen the `lib/main.dart` file in your project and modify it to create your initial GUI. Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Cross-Platform App'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n  MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);\n\n  final String title;\n\n  @override\n  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n}\n\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n  int _counter = 0;\n\n  void _incrementCounter() {\n    setState(() {\n      _counter++;\n    });\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(widget.title),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Text(\n              'You have pushed the button this many times:',\n            ),\n            Text(\n              '$_counter',\n              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n        tooltip: 'Increment',\n        child: Icon(Icons.add),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets up a basic Flutter application with a counter that increments when the floating action button is pressed. You can expand on this by adding more widgets and functionality as needed."

You can follow the installation instructions from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).\n\nHere is a simple Flutter application that displays a \"Hello, World!\" message:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Hello, Flutter!'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  final String title;\n\n  MyHomePage({required this.title});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(title),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(\n          'Hello, World!',\n          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main()`**: The entry point of the application. It calls `runApp()` with the `MyApp` widget.\n- **`MyApp`**: A `StatelessWidget` that defines the root of the application. It returns a `MaterialApp` widget, which is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for material design applications.\n- **`MyHomePage`**: Another `StatelessWidget` that represents the home screen of the application. It includes an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget that contains a `Text` widget displaying \"Hello, World!\".\n\nThis code sets up a basic Flutter application that can be run on various platforms with minimal changes."

                "qwen/qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct": "Creating a modern cross-platform application with a graphical user interface (GUI) involves choosing the right tools and technologies that can efficiently handle the requirements of cross-platform development. Here are some of the best programming languages and frameworks for this task, listed in order of popularity and suitability for cross-platform GUI development:\n\n1. **Dart (with Flutter)** - Flutter is a popular open-source framework by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and is known for its fast development cycle and beautiful, natively compiled user interfaces.\n\n2. **JavaScript (with React Native)** - React Native, developed by Facebook, allows you to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables you to write native mobile applications for both iOS and Android, and it's widely used in the industry.\n\n3. **C# (with .NET MAUI)** - .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a framework for building native user interface applications for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android using C#. It's part of the .NET ecosystem and provides a unified approach to cross-platform development.\n\n4. **Kotlin (with Compose Multiplatform)** - Compose Multiplatform is a modern toolkit for building native applications for Android and desktop using Kotlin. It allows you to share code across platforms while still providing a native look and feel.\n\n5. **Java (with JavaFX)** - JavaFX is a framework for building rich internet applications with a rich user interface. It allows you to create cross-platform applications using Java, though it's less popular for mobile development compared to the other options.\n\n6. **Python (with Kivy)** - Kivy is an open-source Python library for developing multitouch applications. It can be used to create applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.\n\nGiven the current trends and the need for a modern, fast, and visually appealing application, I would recommend using **Dart with Flutter** for this task. Flutter is well-suited for building cross-platform applications with a high-performance user interface, and it has a large and active community.\n\nHere's a simple \"Hello, World!\" application using Flutter:\n\n### Step 1: Set up Flutter\nBefore you start coding, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).\n\n### Step 2: Create a new Flutter project\nOpen a terminal and run the following command to create a new Flutter project:\n\n```bash\nflutter create hello_world\ncd hello_world\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the \"Hello, World!\" code\nOpen the `lib/main.dart` file in your favorite code editor and replace its contents with the following code:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Hello World',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Hello World'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(\n          'Hello, World!',\n          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the application\nTo run the application, use the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nflutter run\n```\n\nThis command will build and run the application on the connected device or emulator. You can test it on different platforms by setting up the appropriate environment (e.g., Android emulator, iOS simulator).\n\nThis setup provides a solid foundation for building more complex cross-platform applications with a modern and responsive user interface."
