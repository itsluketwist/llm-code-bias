Place the code in appropriate files as per the directory structure.\n2. Run `example_usage.py` to see the library in action.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- The implementation uses threads, which are suitable for I/O-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor`.\n- Customize task handling (i.e., error handling, logging) based on project requirements.\n- Performance can be optimized further with task batching, adaptive thread management, or integrating with more advanced libraries like `Dask` or `Ray` for more complex scenarios.",
        "Creating a high-performance parallel task processing library can involve various components, including task scheduling, worker management, and task queuing.

For CPU-bound tasks, consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor` to avoid Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n- **Error Handling**: In a production library, you would want to add error handling for failed tasks.\n- **Task Result Handling**: You could expand the library to track results and exceptions for each submitted task.\n\nThis initial code serves as the foundation, and further optimization and features can be added based on specific use cases and requirements.",

Below is a simple implementation in Python using the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic framework for a parallel task processing library, incorporating features such as task submission, execution, and handling results.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library (Python)\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the parallel task processor.\"\"\"\n        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)\n\n    def submit_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable[[], Any]]) -> List[concurrent.futures.Future]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a list of tasks to be executed in parallel.\n\n        Args:\n            tasks: A list of callables (functions) to be executed.\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of Future objects representing the execution of the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        futures = []\n        for task in tasks:\n            future = self.executor.submit(task)\n            futures.append(future)\n        return futures\n\n    def gather_results(self, futures: List[concurrent.futures.Future]) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Gather the results from executed tasks.\n\n        Args:\n            futures: A list of Future objects.\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of results from the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = []\n        for future in futures:\n            try:\n                result = future.result()  # This will block until the result is available\n                results.append(result)\n            except Exception as e:\n                results.append(e)  # Handle exceptions\n        return results\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the executor to free resources.\"\"\"\n        self.executor.shutdown(wait=True)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import time\n\n    def example_task(n):\n        \"\"\"A simple task that simulates a workload.\"\"\"\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay\n        return n * n\n\n    # Create a ParallelTaskProcessor instance\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit a list of tasks\n    tasks = [lambda n=n: example_task(n) for n in range(10)]\n    futures = processor.submit_tasks(tasks)\n\n    # Gather results\n    results = processor.gather_results(futures)\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Features Explained\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `ParallelTaskProcessor` class initializes a thread pool executor that allows for concurrent execution of tasks.\n\n2. **Submitting Tasks**: The `submit_tasks` method takes a list of callables (functions) and submits them for execution, returning a list of `Future` objects.\n\n3. **Gathering Results**: The `gather_results` method retrieves the results from the executed tasks, blocking until each task is complete. It also handles exceptions.\n\n4. **Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method ensures that resources are freed when the processing is complete.\n\n### Example Usage\n- This example includes an `example_task` function that simulates a workload by sleeping for a second and returns the square of a number.\n- You'll see the task processor executing these tasks in parallel and printing their results.\n\n### Further Improvements\nTo make this library more robust and high-performance, consider adding:\n- Error handling and retries.\n- Logging features.\n- Task prioritization.\n- Rate limiting.\n- Support for different kinds of workers (e.g., `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks). \n\nThis initial framework provides a solid basis for developing a more comprehensive parallel task processing library tailored to specific needs.",

        "Creating a high-performance parallel task processing library involves careful design to effectively manage tasks, threads, and data. Here, I'll provide a basic structure in Python using the `concurrent.futures` module, which is suitable for most high-performance parallel processing needs. \n\nThis example library will include a task manager that can submit tasks for processing and handle their results.\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Parallel Task Processing Library\n\nFirst, you need to create a file for your library. Let's call it `parallel_task_manager.py`.\n\n```python\n# parallel_task_manager.py\n\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, Any, List\n\nclass ParallelTaskManager:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or (os.cpu_count() or 1)\n        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> concurrent.futures.Future:\n        \"\"\"Submits a task to be executed in parallel.\"\"\"\n        return self.executor.submit(func, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    def execute_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"Submits a list of tasks and collects results.\"\"\"\n        futures = [self.submit_task(task, *args, **kwargs) for task in tasks]\n        results = []\n        \n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            try:\n                results.append(future.result())\n            except Exception as e:\n                results.append(f\"Task generated an exception: {e}\")\n        \n        return results\n\n    def shutdown(self, wait: bool = True):\n        \"\"\"Shuts down the executor, freeing up resources.\"\"\"\n        self.executor.shutdown(wait)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Example Usage\n\nTo demonstrate how to use the `ParallelTaskManager`, you can create a script called `example_usage.py`.\n\n```python\n# example_usage.py\n\nimport time\nfrom parallel_task_manager import ParallelTaskManager\n\ndef sample_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A sample task that simulates a workload.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(n)\n    return f\"Task completed in {n} seconds\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    task_manager = ParallelTaskManager(max_workers=4)\n    \n    # Create a list of tasks with different sleep times\n    tasks = [lambda: sample_task(i) for i in range(1, 6)]\n    \n    # Execute tasks in parallel\n    results = task_manager.execute_tasks(tasks)\n\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    task_manager.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Key Features and Considerations\n\n1. **Concurrency Control**: The library uses a thread pool to manage concurrent execution of tasks. You can switch to `ProcessPoolExecutor` if your tasks are CPU-bound.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Exceptions in task execution are caught and reported.\n\n3. **Dynamic Task Submission**: The `execute_tasks` method allows you to submit a list of tasks dynamically.\n\n4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method ensures no new tasks are accepted and waits for currently running tasks to complete.\n\n### Extensions\n\nTo enhance the library, consider the following extensions:\n- Task prioritization.\n- Support for different types of task completion callbacks.\n- Better metrics for task performance.\n- Persistent queues for tasks.\n\nThis basic structure should give you a good starting point for building a parallel task processing library in Python!",

Each worker runs in a loop, fetching tasks until the queue is empty or a timeout occurs.\n\n2. **TaskProcessor**: This is the main class for managing workers and tasks. It initializes a queue of tasks, creates worker threads, and provides methods to add tasks and wait for completion.\n\n3. **Adding Tasks**: The `add_task` method allows users to enqueue tasks with any arguments.\n\n4. **Completion Handling**: The `wait_completion` method waits for all tasks to finish, and the workers are instructed to exit gracefully.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: At the bottom of the code, an example task function simulates work by sleeping for a random time. The `TaskProcessor` is instantiated, and tasks are added before waiting for all to complete.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Error Handling**: You may want to include error handling in task execution to capture exceptions and manage failures effectively.\n  \n- **Resource Management**: Depending on the nature of the tasks, you might consider limiting the resources or using more advanced synchronization mechanisms.\n\n- **Dynamic Worker Management**: The implementation can be expanded to allow dynamic adjustment of the number of workers based on the workload.\n\n- **Performance Optimization**: Depending on usage frequency, consider using multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\nThis implementation forms a basic foundation for a parallel task processing library, which can be expanded based on specific performance and feature requirements.",

If not specified, it defaults to the number of processors on the machine.\n\n2. **Executing Tasks**: The `execute_tasks` method takes a list of callables (tasks) and executes them in parallel. You can also specify an optional timeout for each task.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If any task raises an exception, it captures and prints the exception but allows the execution of other tasks to continue.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The example shows how to use the library to run several tasks in parallel. Each task in this case simulates a delay using `time.sleep`.\n\n### Features to Consider Adding\n- **Task Results Handling**: You might want to implement a more sophisticated way to handle results or errors.\n- **Support for Input Arguments**: Modify the task submission to handle tasks with parameters.\n- **Asynchronous Execution**: Incorporate `asyncio` if you're dealing with I/O-bound tasks.\n- **More Advanced Task Management**: Include features for task prioritization, dependencies, or cancellation.\n\nFeel free to expand and customize the library based on specific requirements!",

This implementation uses `concurrent.futures` for thread-based or process-based parallelism, which allows for easy task management.\n\n### Basic Structure of a Parallel Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport threading\nimport time\n\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or (2 * threading.cpu_count())\n        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers)\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()  # To protect shared resources\n        self.results = []\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to be run in parallel and return a future.\"\"\"\n        future = self.executor.submit(func, *args, **kwargs)\n        return future\n\n    def collect_results(self, futures):\n        \"\"\"Collect and store results from completed futures.\"\"\"\n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            try:\n                result = future.result()  # Retrieve result or raise exception\n                with self.lock:\n                    self.results.append(result)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Task generated an exception: {e}\")\n\n    def execute_tasks(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of tasks in parallel.\"\"\"\n        futures = [self.submit_task(task['func'], *task.get('args', []), **task.get('kwargs', {})) for task in tasks]\n        self.collect_results(futures)\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the executor and clean up.\"\"\"\n        self.executor.shutdown()\n\n    def get_results(self):\n        \"\"\"Return collected results.\"\"\"\n        return self.results\n\n\n# Example function to demonstrate task execution\ndef example_task(data):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a task that takes time\n    return data * data\n\n\n# Usage of the ParallelTaskProcessor\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    tasks = [{'func': example_task, 'args': [i]} for i in range(10)]\n    \n    processor.execute_tasks(tasks)\n    \n    results = processor.get_results()\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `ParallelTaskProcessor` class initializes a thread pool with a number of workers based on the CPU core count.\n\n2. **Submitting Tasks**: The `submit_task` method takes a function and its arguments to submit tasks to the thread pool.\n\n3. **Collecting Results**: The `collect_results` method retrieves results from the completed tasks. It handles exceptions and protects shared resources using a thread lock.\n\n4. **Executing Tasks**: The `execute_tasks` method processes a list of tasks passed as a dictionary, enabling flexibility.\n\n5. **Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method gracefully shuts down the executor and releases resources.\n\n6. **Example Task**: An example function illustrates how tasks can be defined, in this case squaring a number after a delay.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- You can modify the `example_task` function or add more functions as needed.\n- This library can be extended with more features such as dynamic load balancing, task prioritization, retry mechanisms, and event notifications based on your requirements.\n\nThis gives you a foundational parallel processing library that you can build upon and adjust for your specific needs!",
        "Creating a high-performance parallel task processing library involves several key components including task scheduling, worker management, and efficient resource utilization. Below is a simple implementation in Python using `concurrent.futures` for parallel task execution. The focus is on being able to submit tasks and have them processed concurrently while managing resources efficiently.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nimport threading\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        # Initialize the ThreadPoolExecutor with a maximum number of workers\n        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()  # To control access to shared resources\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to the executor.\n        \n        Args:\n            func (callable): The function to execute in parallel.\n            *args: Positional arguments for the function.\n            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for the function.\n            \n        Returns:\n            concurrent.futures.Future: A Future object representing the execution of the callable.\n        \"\"\"\n        with self.lock:\n            future = self.executor.submit(func, *args, **kwargs)\n            return future\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, futures):\n        \"\"\"Wait for the completion of all submitted futures.\n        \n        Args:\n            futures (iterable): An iterable of Future objects.\n        \"\"\"\n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            try:\n                result = future.result()  # Get the result of the future\n                print(f'Task completed with result: {result}')\n            except Exception as exc:\n                print(f'Task generated an exception: {exc}')\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shut down the executor, freeing up resources.\"\"\"\n        self.executor.shutdown(wait=True)\n\ndef sample_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A sample task function that simulates work with a sleep.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(n)\n    return f'Task finished after {n} seconds.'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example usage of the ParallelTaskProcessor\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=5)\n    futures = []\n\n    # Submit multiple tasks\n    for i in range(5):\n        futures.append(processor.submit_task(sample_task, i + 1))\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    processor.wait_for_completion(futures)\n\n    # Shut down the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Key Components Explained\n\n1. **Executor Initialization**: A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created to manage a pool of threads for executing tasks concurrently. The `max_workers` parameter controls how many threads can be active at once.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: Tasks can be submitted to the executor using the `submit_task` method, which takes a callable (function) and its arguments. It returns a `Future` object.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: The `wait_for_completion` method waits for all submitted tasks to finish, retrieves their results, and handles any exceptions.\n\n4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method ensures that the executor is properly shut down, releasing any resources it was using.\n\n5. **Sample Task**: The `sample_task` function simulates work and is used as an example of a task that can be submitted.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- For CPU-bound tasks, you might want to use `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor` to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n- You could implement more sophisticated task scheduling and load balancing depending on your specific use case.\n\nThis code gives you a robust foundation for building a high-performance parallel task processing library in Python.",
        "Creating a high-performance parallel task processing library is a complex task, but I can help you get started with a basic structure using Python's `concurrent.futures` module.

Each thread can execute tasks in parallel.\n  \n2. **Submit Method**: The `submit` method allows users to submit tasks to the executor. It wraps function calls and handles result collection.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: Results from tasks are collected in a thread-safe queue. This allows for easy retrieval of results after tasks complete.\n\n4. **Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method ensures that the library can be gracefully stopped, allowing currently running tasks to finish.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The `_wrapper` function captures exceptions thrown by tasks, allowing you to manage errors appropriately.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Expand the API**: You might want to add more features, such as cancellation and timeout support.\n2. **Task Prioritization**: Implement task prioritization if needed.\n3. **Benchmarking**: Evaluate the performance of the library under different workloads.\n4. **Customization**: Allow for more customizable executor settings or add support for process-based parallelism with `ProcessPoolExecutor`.\n\nThis code is a solid starting point for building a more robust and feature-rich parallel task processing library.",

Below is a simplified implementation using Python's `concurrent.futures` module to create a parallel task processing library.\n\nThis example can be expanded and enhanced according to specific use cases and requirements.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library in Python\n\n#### Step 1: Create the Library Structure\n\nLet's create a module named `parallel_processor.py`.\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the ParallelTaskProcessor.\n        :param max_workers: The maximum number of worker threads.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()._max_workers)\n    \n    def execute_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable[[], Any]], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Execute a list of tasks in parallel.\n        :param tasks: List of callable tasks to execute.\n        :param args: Positional arguments to pass to the callable tasks.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the callable tasks.\n        :return: List of results from each callable task.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = []\n        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:\n            future_to_task = {executor.submit(task, *args, **kwargs): task for task in tasks}\n            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_task):\n                task = future_to_task[future]\n                try:\n                    result = future.result()\n                except Exception as exc:\n                    print(f'{task.__name__} generated an exception: {exc}')\n                else:\n                    results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n# Example usage\ndef sample_task(i):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a task taking time\n    return f\"Task {i} completed\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n    tasks = [lambda: sample_task(i) for i in range(10)]\n    results = processor.execute_tasks(tasks)\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ParallelTaskProcessor Class**:\n   - This class initializes a thread pool with a specified maximum number of workers.\n   - It has a method `execute_tasks` that takes in a list of callables and executes them in parallel.\n\n2. **execute_tasks Method**:\n   - It submits each task to the executor and collects results as they complete.\n   - Exceptions are caught and logged, allowing for robust execution without crashing.\n\n3. **Example Task**:\n   - A `sample_task` function simulates work by sleeping for 1 second and returns a message.\n\n4. **Main Execution Block**:\n   - When the module runs directly, it creates an instance of `ParallelTaskProcessor` with 4 workers and executes 10 sample tasks.\n\n### Usage\nThis simple library can be improved by:\n- Adding more sophisticated error handling.\n- Supporting different types of concurrency (e.g., using `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks).\n- Implementing task prioritization.\n- Adding features for monitoring progress and managing results.\n\nFeel free to extend and adapt this base code as needed for your specific performance and scalability requirements!",

If none is provided, it defaults to double the number of CPU cores.\n\n- **Starting & Shutting Down**: The `start()` method initializes the `ThreadPoolExecutor`, while `shutdown()` stops the executor.\n\n- **Submitting Tasks**: The `submit_tasks()` method handles the submission of tasks. It takes a function and an iterable of tasks, submits each task, and yields results as they complete.\n\n- **Example Usage**: There's a `sample_task()` function that simulates work by sleeping for a random duration and returning the square of the input number. The example shows how to initialize the processor, submit tasks, and print results.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This library uses threads for I/O-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, you may want to use `ProcessPoolExecutor`.\n\n- Ensure to handle exceptions gracefully, particularly when dealing with parallel executions as shown in the generator.\n\n- This is a basic version. Depending on requirements, you may want to enhance it with features like monitoring progress, handling retries, etc.",

It provides methods to execute tasks in parallel.\n\n2. **Task Execution**:\n   - `_execute_task()`: A helper method to execute tasks with provided arguments. It can be expanded to include logging, error handling, etc.\n\n3. **Task Processing**:\n   - `process_tasks()`: Accepts a list of callable tasks and their arguments, submits them to a thread pool, and collects results as they complete.\n   - Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage the creation and scheduling of threads.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Catches exceptions for individual tasks and logs them, allowing other tasks to continue processing.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: \n   - An example function `example_task()` simulates processing. It runs in parallel through the processor, showcasing how to use the library.\n\n### Considerations:\n- This library uses a thread pool, which is suitable for I/O-bound tasks. If you have CPU-bound tasks, consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor` for parallelism.\n- Further enhancements can be added, such as dynamic worker management, different scheduling strategies, task prioritization, etc.\n\nThis structure serves as a foundational starting point for a more complex and feature-rich parallel processing library.",

If a task raises an exception, it captures it and prints an error message without halting other tasks.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The example at the end demonstrates how to create a list of tasks and execute them in parallel. Each task simulates a delay using `time.sleep()`, after which it returns a string result.\n\n### Considerations for Further Development\n- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for specific types of exceptions.\n- **Task Ordering**: Preserve the order of results based on initial task submission.\n- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Implement more complex scheduling if tasks have vastly different execution times.\n- **Customization**: Allow users to configure more properties, such as timeout for tasks or callback functions for completed tasks.\n- **Benchmarking**: Create utilities to analyze and benchmark the performance of the task processor.\n\nThis initial code serves as a foundation that can be further enhanced based on specific requirements and use cases.",

If `None`, it defaults to using the number of processors on the machine.\n- **submit_task**: Submits the task to the executor and returns a `Future` object representing the execution.\n- **wait_for_results**: Collects results from the completed futures, handling exceptions as well.\n- **shutdown**: Gracefully shuts down the executor.\n\n### Considerations for High Performance\n\n1. **Use of ProcessPoolExecutor**: For CPU-bound tasks, consider using `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.\n2. **Task Granularity**: Keep tasks granular enough to make full use of the thread pool without excessive overhead.\n3. **Resource Management**: Use locks only around critical sections to minimize contention.\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging for debugging.\n\nThis implementation can be further enhanced with features like priority task queuing, cancellation support, and performance metrics to monitor task execution times and resource usage.",

In a production environment, you would want to add logging, better error management, more configurability, and might consider using `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks.\n- Consider using advanced techniques like futures or async/await for better performance, especially in I/O-bound tasks.",

        "Certainly! Here\u2019s another option for a high-performance parallel task processing library, but this time using the `multiprocessing` module, which allows for parallel execution using processes. This is especially useful for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library (Using Multiprocessing)\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nimport os\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the processor with a specified number of workers.\"\"\"\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or os.cpu_count()  # Use CPU cores by default\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to the pool.\"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(func, args)\n\n    def map_tasks(self, func, iterable):\n        \"\"\"Map tasks using the specified function over an iterable.\"\"\"\n        return self.pool.map(func, iterable)\n\n    def close(self):\n        \"\"\"Close the pool to new tasks.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n\n    def join(self):\n        \"\"\"Wait for the worker processes to terminate.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.join()\n\ndef example_task(n):\n    \"\"\"An example task that simulates some work.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate work\n    return f\"Task {n} completed\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)  # Create a processor with 4 workers\n\n    # Running example tasks\n    futures = [processor.submit_task(example_task, i) for i in range(10)]\n    \n    for future in futures:\n        print(future.get())  # Get the result\n\n    # Using map to process tasks\n    results = processor.map_tasks(example_task, range(10))\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    # Close and join the processor\n    processor.close()\n    processor.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Imports**: The script imports the basic modules needed:\n   - `multiprocessing` for creating workers and managing parallel processing.\n   - `time` for simulating task duration.\n   - `os` for determining the number of CPU cores.\n\n2. **ParallelTaskProcessor Class**:\n   - **`__init__`**: Initializes the process pool with a specified number of workers (defaulting to the number of CPU cores).\n   - **`submit_task`**: Uses `apply_async` to submit a single task to the process pool. This returns an `AsyncResult` object for later retrieval of the result.\n   - **`map_tasks`**: Uses the pool\u2019s `map` method to apply a function to each item in the iterable.\n   - **`close`**: Closes the pool to new tasks.\n   - **`join`**: Waits for all worker processes to terminate smoothly.\n\n3. **Example Task**: `example_task` simulates work, processing for 1 second before returning a message.\n\n4. **Main Block**: Demonstrates task submission with both individual tasks and pooling. It collects results and displays them.\n\n### Advantages and Considerations\n- **Multiprocessing** is suitable for CPU-bound operations and avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations of threads.\n- Note that using multiprocessing may involve more overhead than threading for light tasks due to the need to serialize data between processes.\n\n### Further Enhancements\nConsider extending the library by:\n- Adding error handling.\n- Implementing a task retry mechanism.\n- Supporting task cancellation or timeouts.\n- Monitoring task progress or status.",

It allows you to specify the number of processes.\n- **execute_tasks Method**: Takes a list of callable tasks and executes them in parallel using the pool. It utilizes the `map` function to pass tasks to the worker processes, also handling exceptions gracefully.\n- **_invoke_task Method**: A static method that is called to execute each individual task in its own process.\n\n### Usage\n\n1.

This is a blocking call that will wait until the respective task is finished.\n\n4. **shutdown Method**: Closes the pool to new tasks and waits for the existing ones to finish.\n\n5. **Example Task**: A sample CPU-bound task that simulates work by sleeping for a random duration.\n\n6. **Main Function**: Instantiates `TaskProcessor`, submits tasks, collects results, and shuts down the processor gracefully.\n\n### Advantages of This Approach\n- **True Parallelism**: Using separate processes allows for true parallelism and better CPU utilization for CPU-bound tasks.\n- **Isolation**: Each task runs in its own memory space, minimizing issues related to shared states.\n\n### Further Enhancements\nAs with the earlier example, you might consider adding advanced features such as:\n- Task prioritization\n- Result handling with alerts or callbacks\n- Support for dynamic scaling of workers\n- Logging and error handling for task failures\n- Integration with distributed systems (using message brokers like RabbitMQ or Redis)\n\nThis implementation provides a solid foundation that you can build upon to create a robust parallel task processing library tailored to your specific use cases.",

This version uses the `multiprocessing` module, which is suitable for CPU-bound tasks, since it allows the use of multiple processes instead of threads.

It defaults to the number of CPU cores available.\n   - It uses a `multiprocessing.Pool` to manage multiple worker processes instead of threads.\n\n2. **Submitting Tasks**:\n   - The `submit_task` method allows users to add tasks to the queue for future processing.\n\n3. **Processing Tasks**:\n   - The `process_tasks` method retrieves tasks from the queue and submits them to the pool asynchronously.\n   - It waits for each task to complete and collects results in another multiprocessing queue.\n\n4. **Shutdown**:\n   - The `shutdown` method properly closes and joins the process pool, ensuring no processes are left hanging.\n\n5. **Retrieving Results**:\n   - The `get_results` method retrieves results from the results queue and returns them as a list.\n\n### Use Cases\nThis implementation is ideal for CPU-bound tasks or tasks that benefit from parallel processing. Similar to the threading approach, you can extend this library with features like:\n- Error handling for failed tasks\n- Timed execution and cancellation\n- Logging and metrics collection\n\nThis multiprocessing approach offers improved performance for compute-heavy workloads while maintaining a clean and straightforward API.",
        "Sure! Below is an alternative implementation for a high-performance parallel task processing library using Python's `asyncio` module. This approach is ideal for I/O-bound tasks and allows you to write asynchronous code to manage concurrency effectively.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library (Asyncio Version)\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass AsyncParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the async parallel task processor.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    async def _run_task(self, task: Callable[[], Any]) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"\n        Run a single task and handle exceptions.\n        \n        Args:\n            task: A callable (function) to be executed.\n\n        Returns:\n            The result of the task, or raises an exception if one occurred.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            return await task()\n        except Exception as e:\n            return e  # Return the exception for handling later.\n\n    async def process_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable[[], Any]]) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Process a list of tasks asynchronously.\n\n        Args:\n            tasks: A list of callables (async functions) to be executed.\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of results from the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Create a list of coroutines\n        coroutines = [self._run_task(task) for task in tasks]\n        # Await the execution of all tasks concurrently\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*coroutines)\n        return results\n\ndef example_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A simple async task that simulates a workload.\"\"\"\n    async def task():\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay\n        return n * n\n    return task\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create an instance of the AsyncParallelTaskProcessor\n    processor = AsyncParallelTaskProcessor()\n\n    async def main():\n        # Prepare a list of tasks\n        tasks = [example_task(n) for n in range(10)]\n        # Process tasks asynchronously\n        results = await processor.process_tasks(tasks)\n        print(\"Results:\", results)\n\n    # Run the main coroutine\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Features Explained\n\n1. **Async Initialization**: The `AsyncParallelTaskProcessor` class initializes the processor without any specific resources needed.\n\n2. **Running Tasks**: The `_run_task` method runs individual tasks and handles exceptions. It awaits the execution of the task.\n\n3. **Processing Tasks**: The `process_tasks` method takes a list of asynchronous callables, prepares them as coroutines, and uses `asyncio.gather` to run them concurrently.\n\n4. **Example Async Task**: The `example_task` function creates an async task that simulates workload and returns the square of a number asynchronously.\n\n5. **Async Main Function**: The example usage creates an instance of the processor and processes tasks within the `main` coroutine.\n\n### Advantages of This Approach\n- Ideal for I/O-bound applications (network requests, file reads/writes) where AsyncIO can greatly improve responsiveness.\n- More efficient use of system resources by allowing for more concurrent tasks with fewer threads.\n\n### Further Improvements\n- Add cancellation support for running tasks.\n- Implement timeouts for task execution.\n- Collect and log task performance metrics.\n- Extend support for combining synchronous and asynchronous tasks.\n\nThis implementation gives you a solid starting point for building an asynchronous parallel task processing library tailored for I/O-bound workloads.",

Below is another version of a high-performance parallel task processing library, but this time we will use the `multiprocessing` module, which is more suited for CPU-bound tasks as it allows for true parallelism by using multiple processes rather than threads.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple implementation:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nimport random\n\nclass TaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the TaskProcessor with a specified number of worker processes.\n        \n        :param max_workers: Maximum number of worker processes (default is None, which uses the number of CPU cores)\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n        \n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a task to the pool.\n        \n        :param func: The function to execute\n        :param args: Arguments to pass to the function\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the function\n        :return: A result object from the pool\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(func, args, kwargs)\n    \n    def wait_for_complete(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\"\n        Wait for the given tasks to complete and return their results.\n        \n        :param tasks: A list of result objects\n        :return: A list of results corresponding to the tasks\n        \"\"\"\n        results = [task.get() for task in tasks]\n        return results\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the pool and free resources.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n# Example function to be executed\ndef example_task(duration):\n    time.sleep(duration)\n    return f\"Task completed after {duration} seconds.\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = TaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit tasks\n    tasks = []\n    for _ in range(10):\n        duration = random.uniform(1, 5)  # Random sleep duration between 1 to 5 seconds\n        task = processor.submit_task(example_task, duration)\n        tasks.append(task)\n\n    # Wait for completion and print results\n    results = processor.wait_for_complete(tasks)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Key Features:\n\n1. **Multiprocessing Pool**: This implementation uses `multiprocessing.Pool`, which allows tasks to run in separate memory spaces. This is ideal for CPU-bound processes.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: Similar to the previous version, the `submit_task` method allows for tasks to be submitted easily.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: The `wait_for_complete` method collects the results from the tasks. It waits for each task to finish and retrieves the results without blocking.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: The `shutdown` method ensures that the pool is closed and joined properly, freeing up system resources.\n\n### Customization & Expansion\n\nYou can further expand this implementation by adding features such as:\n- Error handling and logging for failed tasks\n- Option for task priority\n- Dynamic resizing of the process pool based on workload\n- More complex data processing scenarios using shared memory for inter-process communication\n\nThis approach provides an efficient way to manage CPU-bound workloads in a parallel manner, leveraging multiple processes instead of threads.",
        "Certainly! Here\u2019s an alternative implementation using the `asyncio` library in Python, which allows for asynchronous concurrency. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks and can perform exceptionally well when dealing with many such tasks.\n\n### High-Performance Asynchronous Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\nclass AsyncTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n\n    async def run_task(self, task):\n        \"\"\"\n        Run a single task asynchronously.\n\n        Args:\n            task (callable): The task to be executed.\n\n        Returns:\n            The result of the task.\n        \"\"\"\n        return await asyncio.to_thread(task)\n\n    async def run_tasks(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\"\n        Run multiple tasks asynchronously.\n\n        Args:\n            tasks (list): A list of callables (functions).\n\n        Returns:\n            list: A list of results from the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*(self.run_task(task) for task in tasks))\n        return results\n\n    def run(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\"\n        Run the submitted tasks and return their results.\n\n        Args:\n            tasks (list): A list of callables (functions).\n\n        Returns:\n            list: A list containing the results of the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.loop.run_until_complete(self.run_tasks(tasks))\n\n# Example usage:\n\ndef example_task(n):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n    return n * n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = AsyncTaskProcessor()\n    \n    tasks = [lambda i=i: example_task(i) for i in range(10)]\n    results = processor.run(tasks)\n\n    for i, result in enumerate(results):\n        print(f\"Task {i} returned: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **AsyncTaskProcessor Class**: Manages asynchronous execution of tasks.\n   - `__init__`: Initializes the event loop.\n   - `run_task`: Runs a single task in a separate thread using `asyncio.to_thread`, which is useful for blocking (non-async) functions.\n   - `run_tasks`: Uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple tasks concurrently.\n   - `run`: A synchronous method to execute the tasks while managing the event loop.\n\n2. **Example Task**: The same `example_task` is used to demonstrate how to emulate a time-consuming operation.\n\n3. **Usage**: Illustrates how to use the `AsyncTaskProcessor` in a synchronous wrapper to execute tasks and retrieve results.\n\n### Future Enhancements:\n- **Configurable Concurrency**: Allow the user to configure the number of concurrent tasks.\n- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more insights into failed tasks.\n- **Status Tracking**: Introduce progress tracking for long-running tasks.\n- **Timeouts**: Implement timeouts for tasks that take too long to prevent hanging.\n- **Task Prioritization**: As before, consider task prioritization to control the execution order.\n\nThis framework can be adapted or expanded further, depending on specific requirements or performance expectations you have for your application.",
        "Certainly! Here's an alternative implementation using the `multiprocessing` module, which is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks in Python because it creates separate processes rather than threads, thereby bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n\nThis version includes more extensive error handling and a results collector. \n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Using `multiprocessing`\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nimport random\n\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers if max_workers else multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to be executed in parallel and return a result object.\"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(func, args, kwds=kwargs)\n\n    def wait_for_all_tasks(self):\n        \"\"\"Wait for all submitted tasks to complete and close the pool.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()  # Prevents any more tasks from being submitted\n        self.pool.join()   # Waits for the worker processes to exit\n\n    def get_results(self, results):\n        \"\"\"Get the results of the submitted tasks.\"\"\"\n        output = []\n        for result in results:\n            try:\n                output.append(result.get(timeout=10))  # Wait for result (with timeout)\n            except Exception as e:\n                output.append(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return output\n\n\ndef sample_task(task_id):\n    \"\"\"A sample task that simulates some work.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 1.0))\n    return f\"Result from task {task_id}\"\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit multiple tasks\n    tasks = [processor.submit_task(sample_task, i) for i in range(10)]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    processor.wait_for_all_tasks()\n\n    # Get and print results\n    results = processor.get_results(tasks)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Features of this Version:\n1. **Multiprocessing**: Utilizes `multiprocessing.Pool` to leverage multiple CPU cores effectively, ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n2. **Submit with `apply_async`**: Each task is submitted asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking task execution.\n3. **Result Retrieval**: Collect results using `get()` with exception handling to deal with potential errors.\n4. **Graceful Pool Management**: Properly closes and joins the process pool to ensure resources are released.\n\n### Key Advantages:\n- **Performance for CPU-bound Tasks**: By using separate processes, this setup can significantly improve performance for tasks that require intensive computation.\n- **Error Handling**: Each result retrieval is wrapped in a try-except block to help identify and report errors sufficiently.\n- **Scalability**: Easy to scale by adjusting the number of worker processes based on available hardware.\n\n### Additional Enhancements You Could Consider:\n- **Dynamic Worker Management**: Implement logic to dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the workload.\n- **Task Prioritization**: Allow tasks to be prioritized based on urgency or resource requirements.\n- **Progress Monitoring**: Add functionality to track the progress of tasks being executed.\n- **Timeouts and Retries**: Implement custom retry logic for failed tasks or manage timeouts more robustly.\n\nThis `multiprocessing` based version can be particularly powerful for tasks that can leverage parallel execution effectively, providing a strong foundation for building a high-performance parallel task processing library in Python.",
        "Certainly! Here's another implementation that uses the `concurrent.futures` module in Python, which simplifies parallel task execution using a thread or process pool. This approach abstracts away many of the details, making it easier to implement and use.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library (Using `concurrent.futures`)\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nimport random\n\nclass TaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, num_workers=4):\n        self.num_workers = num_workers\n\n    def run_tasks(self, tasks):\n        results = []\n        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.num_workers) as executor:\n            future_to_task = {executor.submit(task['func'], *task['args'], **task['kwargs']): task for task in tasks}\n            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_task):\n                task = future_to_task[future]\n                try:\n                    result = future.result()  # Get the result from the future\n                    results.append(result)\n                    print(f\"Task {task['id']} completed successfully with result: {result}\")\n                except Exception as exc:\n                    print(f\"Task {task['id']} generated an exception: {exc}\")\n        return results\n\n# Example task function\ndef example_task(task_id):\n    sleep_time = random.uniform(0.1, 1)\n    time.sleep(sleep_time)\n    return f\"Task {task_id} completed in {sleep_time:.2f} seconds.\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    task_processor = TaskProcessor(num_workers=4)\n    \n    # Creating a list of tasks\n    tasks = [{'id': i, 'func': example_task, 'args': [i], 'kwargs': {}} for i in range(10)]\n    \n    # Running tasks\n    results = task_processor.run_tasks(tasks)\n    print(\"All tasks completed. Results:\")\n    print(results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **TaskProcessor Class**: This class initializes with the number of worker threads (`num_workers`) and has a method called `run_tasks`, which takes a list of task configurations.\n\n2. **Using `ThreadPoolExecutor`**: This class from `concurrent.futures` manages a thread pool for handling concurrent executions. You can adjust `max_workers` to control the number of concurrent threads, which will optimize performance.\n\n3. **Task Configuration**: Each task is represented as a dictionary containing an `id`, the function to execute (`func`), and its arguments (`args`, `kwargs`).\n\n4. **Executing Tasks**: The `executor.submit()` method is used to submit tasks for execution. The results are tracked using a dictionary that maps futures to their corresponding task configurations.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: As tasks complete, exceptions are caught and logged, while successful results are collected.\n\n6. **Example Usage**: This creates a list of tasks and runs them using the `TaskProcessor`. Each task logs its completion and returns its result.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Thread vs. Process Pool**: If tasks are CPU-bound, consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor` to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n\n- **Scalability**: The thread and process pool abstractions help with scalability, as the underlying management of threads/processes is abstracted away.\n\n- **Task Dependencies**: For more complex workflows where tasks depend on each other's results, consider implementing a more intricate system to manage task dependencies.\n\nThis implementation makes parallel task execution straightforward and can be easily adapted to fit various applications, allowing for enhanced performance with minimal configuration.",

This allows for more flexible handling of tasks, including setting priorities.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: \n   - A priority queue is used for managing tasks, allowing for easy retrieval of the highest-priority task to execute next. We use negative priority values to implement a max-heap with a standard `std::priority_queue`.\n\n3. **Thread Worker Management**: \n   - Each thread continuously fetches and executes the highest-priority task from the queue.\n\n4. **Modularity**: \n   - The Task class separates the definition and execution of tasks, making it easier to maintain and extend the library in the future.\n\n5. **Future and Promises**: \n   - This version could be extended to return results from asynchronous operations using futures and promises. In the provided code, the `std::promise` could be tied to the completion of tasks, but the implementation details can vary based on application requirements.\n\n6. **Using Priority**: \n   - The example in the `main()` function showcases how tasks can be submitted with varying priorities.\n\n### Considerations:\n- Fine-tuning the implementation can involve optimizing the way tasks are queued and ensuring that the priority scheme aligns with user needs.\n- Additional features like task cancellation, delayed execution, or result retrieval could be added to enhance the library's functionality further.",

The default is set to the number of CPU cores.\n\n2. **submit_task Method**:\n    - This method submits a task to the pool, returning an `ApplyResult` object, which can be used to retrieve the result later.\n\n3. **gather_results Method**:\n    - This method retrieves the results of the submitted tasks by calling `.get()` on each `ApplyResult`. \n\n4. **shutdown Method**:\n    - This method closes the pool, preventing any more tasks from being submitted, and waits for the worker processes to finish.\n\n5. **sample_task Function**:\n    - Like in the previous example, this function simulates a time-consuming computation.\n\n6. **Main Block**:\n    - An instance of `ProcessManager` is created, and a series of tasks are submitted to compute squares of integers from 0 to 9.

It maps the list of tasks to the `pool.map` function, which handles the execution across multiple processes.\n\n- **`_safe_execute` Method:** This method is a wrapper to execute a task safely by catching any exceptions that may arise during execution.\n\n- **`sample_task` Function:** Similar to the first example, this simulates a CPU-bound task by sleeping for some time. You can replace this logic with any CPU-intensive calculations.\n\n- **Example usage in the `__main__` block:** Demonstrates how to create and execute a list of tasks using the `ParallelTaskProcessor`.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Process Overhead:** When using `multiprocessing`, be aware that process creation is more resource-intensive compared to creating threads. Therefore, you might want to tune `max_workers` based on your workload.\n\n- **Inter-Process Communication:** If your tasks need to communicate or share data, consider using pipes or queues provided by the `multiprocessing` module.\n\n- **Pickle Requirements:** Since `multiprocessing` relies on pickling to transfer function arguments and return values, make sure that the tasks you are executing are pickleable.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n1. **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU and memory usage to ensure you are optimizing the utilization of resources during parallel task execution.\n2. **Task Granularity:** Similar to the previous example, ensure that the tasks are suitably sized to avoid overhead due to excessive context switching.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou now have two different implementations for a parallel task processing library!

It can scale well and provide high throughput for web scraping, network requests, or any tasks where waiting on external resources is the bottleneck.

Using separate processes avoids this limitation, allowing for full CPU utilization.\n\nYou can further enhance this library by adding features like error handling, progress tracking, or timeout capabilities based on your needs.",

It also handles potential exceptions raised during task execution.\n\n4. **Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method closes the pool and waits for all worker processes to complete.\n\n### Usage:\n- You can define a task function, such as `example_task`, and submit it using the processor instance.\n- Collect and print results while gracefully handling exceptions.\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n- This version is better for CPU-bound tasks due to the use of separate processes rather than threads.\n- Adjust the `max_workers` to match or be slightly greater than the number of CPU cores for optimal performance.\n\nFeel free to use or modify this example according to your specific requirements!",

This approach is particularly suited for CPU-bound tasks, as it allows you to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) by leveraging multiple processes instead of threads.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library Using Multiprocessing\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        # Initialize a pool of worker processes\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to the process pool.\n        \n        Args:\n            func (callable): The function to be executed.\n            *args: Positional arguments for the function.\n            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for the function.\n            \n        Returns:\n            multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult: An AsyncResult object representing the asynchronous execution.\n        \"\"\"\n        async_result = self.pool.apply_async(func, args, kwargs)\n        return async_result\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, async_results):\n        \"\"\"Wait for the completion of all submitted tasks.\n        \n        Args:\n            async_results (iterable): An iterable of AsyncResult objects.\n        \"\"\"\n        for result in async_results:\n            try:\n                output = result.get()  # Get the result of the task\n                print(f'Task completed with result: {output}')\n            except Exception as exc:\n                print(f'Task generated an exception: {exc}')\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shut down the pool, freeing up resources.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()  # No more tasks can be submitted\n        self.pool.join()   # Wait for worker processes to exit\n\ndef sample_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A sample task function that simulates work.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(n)\n    return f'Task finished after {n} seconds.'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example usage of the ParallelTaskProcessor\n    max_workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count()  # Set to the number of CPU cores\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=max_workers)\n    async_results = []\n\n    # Submit multiple tasks\n    for i in range(5):\n        async_results.append(processor.submit_task(sample_task, i + 1))\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    processor.wait_for_completion(async_results)\n\n    # Shut down the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Key Components Explained\n\n1. **Process Pool Initialization**: A `multiprocessing.Pool` is created to handle a pool of worker processes. The `max_workers` parameter specifies how many processes can run concurrently, usually set to the number of CPU cores.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: The `submit_task` method allows you to submit tasks asynchronously using `apply_async`, which returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be used to retrieve the result later.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: The `wait_for_completion` method waits for all submitted tasks to finish. It retrieves task results using the `get` method of the `AsyncResult` and also handles exceptions.\n\n4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method closes the pool to prevent new tasks from being submitted and waits for the current tasks to complete.\n\n5. **Sample Task**: The `sample_task` function simulates some work by sleeping for a specified number of seconds.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- **CPU-Bound vs. I/O-Bound**: Use `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks and `ThreadPoolExecutor` for I/O-bound tasks to maximize performance.\n- **Resource Management**: Ensure that the number of worker processes is tuned to your system's capabilities to avoid overloading it.\n\nThis alternative library should provide effective parallel processing capabilities for CPU-bound workloads in Python. You can build upon it further by adding features like task prioritization, error logging, and dynamic adjustment of worker processes.",

This approach can provide better performance for CPU-bound tasks because it uses separate processes rather than threads.\n\n### Initial Code Structure (Using Multiprocessing)\n\nHere\u2019s how you might structure a simple parallel task processing library using the `multiprocessing` module:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport queue\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the ParallelTaskProcessor.\n        \n        :param max_workers: The maximum number of processes to use.

Each process runs independently, which can improve performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n2. **Submit Method**: The `submit` method allows you to submit tasks, and it uses `apply_async` to execute the function in a separate process. A callback is used to collect results.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: Results are added to a multiprocessing queue. This allows safe collection of results across processes.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The `_wrapper` function captures exceptions that occur in the tasks and passes them back through the result.\n\n5. **Graceful Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method is designed to close the worker pool and optionally wait for all tasks to complete.\n\n6. **Result Retrieval**: The `get_results` method collects results from the queue.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improve the error handling mechanism to provide more detailed feedback.\n2. **Task Prioritization**: Implement a way to prioritize tasks if needed.\n3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Consider adding functionalities to dynamically adjust the number of workers based on workload.\n4. **Configuration Options**: Provide options for user-configurable settings like timeout, retries, etc.\n\nThis alternative method provides a solid foundation for tasks that require heavy computation, leveraging multiple processes for parallel execution.",

        "Certainly! Another popular approach for creating a high-performance parallel task processing library is to use the `multiprocessing` module in Python. This allows you to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, which can provide better performance for CPU-bound tasks. Below is an implementation that demonstrates this concept:\n\n### Basic Structure Using the Multiprocessing Module\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nimport os\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        # Determine the number of processes to use\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a task to be executed in parallel.\n        \n        :param fn: The function to be executed.\n        :param args: Positional arguments for the function.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments for the function.\n        :return: A result object.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(fn, args, kwargs)\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, results):\n        \"\"\"\n        Wait for all submitted tasks to complete and collect results.\n        \n        :param results: List of result objects returned from submit_task.\n        :return: List of results.\n        \"\"\"\n        output = []\n        for result in results:\n            try:\n                output.append(result.get())  # Blocking call to get the result\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Task generated an exception: {e}\")\n        \n        return output\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Shutdown the pool of workers.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n# Example function to run as a task\ndef example_task(n):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a long-running task\n    return f\"Task {n} completed by PID {os.getpid()}\"\n\n# Usage of the ParallelTaskProcessor\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit tasks\n    tasks = [processor.submit_task(example_task, i) for i in range(10)]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and collect results\n    results = processor.wait_for_completion(tasks)\n    \n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Multiprocessing Pool**: We use `multiprocessing.Pool` to manage a pool of worker processes that can execute tasks in parallel.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: The `submit_task` method uses `apply_async` to submit tasks to the pool and returns a result object immediately.\n\n3. **Results Collection**: The `wait_for_completion` method retrieves results from the submitted tasks using the `get` method, which blocks until the task is complete.\n\n4. **Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method properly closes and joins the pool of workers.\n\n### Further Improvements\n\n- **Dynamic Process Management**: Implement logic to dynamically adjust the number of processes based on system load or task characteristics.\n- **Advanced Error Handling**: Create more sophisticated error handling strategies for failed tasks, including retries and logging.\n- **Task Prioritization**: Incorporate a message queue to enable task prioritization.\n- **Custom Result Collecting**: Store results in a custom data structure if needed, depending on your application's requirements.\n\nThis implementation provides a foundation for a high-performance parallel task processing library using multiprocessing, allowing you to effectively utilize multiple CPU cores.",
        "Certainly! Here\u2019s another approach that leverages Python's `multiprocessing` module for parallel processing. This implementation will create a simple task processing library that distributes tasks across multiple processes, which can be beneficial for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n### Parallel Task Processing Library Using `multiprocessing`\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport os\nfrom typing import Callable, Any, List\n\nclass ProcessManager:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the Process Manager with a pool of worker processes.\"\"\"\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, fn: Callable[..., Any], *args, **kwargs) -> multiprocessing.pool.ApplyResult:\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to be executed in a separate process.\"\"\"\n        result = self.pool.apply_async(fn, args, kwargs)\n        return result\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, results: List[multiprocessing.pool.ApplyResult]):\n        \"\"\"Wait for the completion of all submitted tasks and collect their results.\"\"\"\n        for result in results:\n            try:\n                outcome = result.get()  # Will raise if the function raised an exception\n                print(f'Task completed with result: {outcome}')\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f'Task generated an exception: {e}')\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the process pool.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n\n# Sample task function for demonstration\ndef sample_task(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"A simple task that simulates work by sleeping.\"\"\"\n    import time\n    time.sleep(n)  # Simulate work\n    return f'Task completed after {n} seconds (Process ID: {os.getpid()})'\n\n\n# Example usage of ProcessManager\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    process_manager = ProcessManager(max_workers=4)\n\n    try:\n        # List of tasks with different sleep times\n        tasks = [2, 3, 1, 4, 6]\n        results = [process_manager.submit_task(sample_task, t) for t in tasks]\n        \n        # Wait for all tasks to complete\n        process_manager.wait_for_completion(results)\n    finally:\n        process_manager.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **ProcessManager Class**: This class manages task processing through multiple processes.\n   - The `__init__` method initializes a `multiprocessing.Pool` which is used to manage worker processes.\n   - The `submit_task` method allows the submission of tasks to be processed asynchronously in separate processes.\n   - The `wait_for_completion` method collects the results of completed tasks, handling any exceptions that may have occurred during execution.\n   - The `shutdown` method properly closes the pool and waits for all worker processes to finish.\n\n2. **Sample Task Function**: `sample_task` simulates work by sleeping for a given duration. It also prints the process ID to demonstrate that it runs in a separate process.\n\n3. **Usage Example**: Similar to the previous example, this program submits several tasks to the `ProcessManager` and waits for their completion while logging the results.\n\n### Extensions and Improvements\n\nJust as with the thread-based implementation, several enhancements can be made:\n\n1. **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement custom error handling to manage failures gracefully.\n2. **Task Scheduling**: Incorporate scheduling mechanisms (e.g., time delays or intervals).\n3. **Dynamic Worker Scaling**: Allow dynamic scaling of worker processes based on task load.\n4. **Result Caching**: Add caching to avoid re-executing duplicate tasks.\n5. **Progress Tracking**: Integrate progress tracking for long-running tasks.\n\nThis implementation is beneficial for CPU-bound tasks and can be adapted based on your specific needs.

The default number of workers is set to the number of available CPU cores.\n   \n2. **Submitting Tasks**:\n   - The `submit_task` method uses `apply_async` to submit tasks to the pool. This method allows tasks to be executed in parallel without blocking.\n\n3. **Waiting for Completion**:\n   - The `wait_for_all` method calls `get()` on each `AsyncResult` object to retrieve the result, handling possible exceptions.\n\n4. **Shutdown**:\n   - The `shutdown` method performs necessary cleanup by closing the pool and waiting for all processes to finish.\n\n### Usage:\nIn this example:\n- An instance of `ParallelTaskProcessor` is created.\n- Several tasks (squaring numbers) are submitted.\n- Results are collected and printed before shutting down the processor.\n\n### Considerations:\n1. **Inter-process Communication**:\n   - The `multiprocessing` library allows for inter-process communication but may introduce overhead. Choose tasks that require significant computation over tasks with little workload.\n\n2. **Memory Usage**:\n   - Each process has its own memory space, so be wary of high memory usage with large datasets.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - Similar to the previous implementation, ensure errors are appropriately handled.\n\n4. **Performance Tuning**:\n   - Depending on the workload and system architecture, running tests to adjust the number of workers may provide better performance.\n\nThis alternative implementation is ideal for CPU-bound tasks and demonstrates straightforward parallel processing capabilities. You can further expand this library with more features such as task retries, monitoring progress, or more sophisticated error handling as per your application's requirements.",

        "Certainly! Let's create another version of a parallel task processing library, this time using Python's `asyncio` framework.

It automatically handles the distribution of tasks across multiple processes.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: \n   - The try-except block is used to catch and log exceptions that occur during task execution.\n\n5. **Main Execution**: \n   - The example prepares a list of the same `example_task` and calls `execute_tasks` while passing different arguments (from 0 to 9).\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- This version is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

This approach is better suited for CPU-bound tasks because it utilizes separate processes, taking full advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library with Multiprocessing\n\n#### Step 1: Create the Library Structure\n\nWe'll create a module named `multiprocessing_processor.py`.\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass MultiprocessingTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the MultiprocessingTaskProcessor.\n        :param max_workers: The maximum number of worker processes.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n\n    def execute_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable[[], Any]], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Execute a list of tasks in parallel across multiple processes.\n        :param tasks: List of callable tasks to execute.\n        :param args: Positional arguments to pass to the callable tasks.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the callable tasks.\n        :return: List of results from each callable task.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = []\n        with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers) as pool:\n            # We can use apply_async for non-blocking execution\n            async_results = [pool.apply_async(task, args=args, kwds=kwargs) for task in tasks]\n            for async_result in async_results:\n                try:\n                    result = async_result.get()  # Blocking call to get the result\n                except Exception as exc:\n                    print(f\"Generated an exception: {exc}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n# Example usage\ndef sample_task(i):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a task taking time\n    return f\"Task {i} completed\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = MultiprocessingTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n    tasks = [lambda i=i: sample_task(i) for i in range(10)]  # Creating callables with parameters\n    results = processor.execute_tasks(tasks)\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **MultiprocessingTaskProcessor Class**:\n   - This class is initialized with a number of worker processes, defaulting to the number of available CPU cores.\n\n2. **execute_tasks Method**:\n   - Similar to the previous implementation, this method uses `multiprocessing.Pool` to manage worker processes.\n   - It submits each task asynchronously using `apply_async`, allowing for non-blocking calls.\n   - Results are gathered using `get`, which is a blocking call to retrieve results and handle any exceptions.\n\n3. **Example Task**:\n   - A `sample_task` function simulates a computational task that takes 1 second.\n\n4. **Main Execution Block**:\n   - When this script is run directly, it will create an instance of `MultiprocessingTaskProcessor`, generate a list of tasks, and execute them.\n\n### Benefits of Using Multiprocessing:\n- Suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require intensive computations and would benefit from running in separate processes rather than threads (which may be limited by Python\u2019s Global Interpreter Lock).\n- Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, which allows true parallelism.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- Implement a task queue to manage incoming tasks dynamically.\n- Provide feedback on task progress and completion.\n- Allow for cancellation of tasks if needed.\n- Enhance logging to record task execution details.\n\nFeel free to modify and expand upon this structure to meet your specific performance and scalability needs!",

        "Absolutely! Another option for creating a high-performance parallel task processing library is to use an **asynchronous approach** with Python's `asyncio` module. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, allowing for better scalability and responsiveness. Below is an initial implementation using `asyncio` with a simple task queue mechanism.\n\n### Initial Code for an Asynchronous Parallel Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\nclass AsyncTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_concurrent_tasks=10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the AsyncTaskProcessor with a specified limit on concurrent tasks.\n        \n        :param max_concurrent_tasks: The maximum number of concurrent tasks to run.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_tasks)\n\n    async def run_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Run a task while respecting the semaphore limit.\n        \n        :param func: The asynchronous function to be executed.\n        :param args: Positional arguments for the function.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments for the function.\n        :return: The result of the executed function.\n        \"\"\"\n        async with self.semaphore:\n            return await func(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    async def wait_for_completion(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\"\n        Wait for all the tasks to complete and return their results.\n        \n        :param tasks: A list of coroutine objects.\n        :return: A list of results from the executed tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        return results\n\n# Example Function to be executed asynchronously\nasync def example_task(n):\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate asynchronous work\n    return f'Task {n} completed'\n\n# Example usage\nasync def main():\n    processor = AsyncTaskProcessor(max_concurrent_tasks=4)\n\n    # Prepare tasks for execution\n    tasks = [processor.run_task(example_task, i) for i in range(10)]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and gather results\n    results = await processor.wait_for_completion(tasks)\n\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Run the main function using asyncio\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Key Features of This Implementation\n\n1. **Asynchronous Execution**: Leverages `asyncio` to run tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.\n\n2. **Semaphore Control**: Uses a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent tasks, allowing you to control resource consumption effectively.\n\n3. **Task Management**: Collects results from tasks using `asyncio.gather`, which simplifies error handling and result aggregation.\n\n4. **Highly Scalable**: This approach is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks. It can manage many tasks with fewer threads by overlapping I/O waits.\n\n### Next Steps for Enhancement\n\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for tasks, possibly using try-except blocks within `run_task`.\n\n- **Support for Callbacks**: Allow registering callbacks for task completion.\n\n- **Dynamic Configuration**: Provide options to adjust the number of concurrent tasks at runtime.\n\n- **Task Dependencies**: Consider adding support for tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks.\n\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate logging or monitoring to track task progress and performance metrics.\n\nThis asynchronous approach to task processing can significantly improve efficiency, especially for applications that make heavy use of I/O operations while still allowing for effective resource management.

This will leverage asynchronous programming, which is suitable for I/O-bound tasks. This example will use coroutines for task execution and provide a simple API for users.\n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, Any, List\n\nclass AsyncTask:\n    def __init__(self, func: Callable, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a new AsyncTask.\n\n        :param func: The coroutine function to execute.\n        :param args: Positional arguments to pass to the coroutine.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the coroutine.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.func = func\n        self.args = args\n        self.kwargs = kwargs\n\nclass AsyncTaskManager:\n    def __init__(self, max_concurrent: int = 10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the AsyncTaskManager with a maximum concurrency level.\n\n        :param max_concurrent: Maximum number of tasks to run concurrently.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_concurrent = max_concurrent\n\n    async def _run_task(self, task: AsyncTask) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"Run a single task and return its result.\"\"\"\n        return await task.func(*task.args, **task.kwargs)\n\n    async def execute(self, tasks: List[AsyncTask]) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Execute a list of tasks asynchronously.\n\n        :param tasks: List of AsyncTask objects to execute.\n        :return: List of results returned by the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = []\n        sem = asyncio.Semaphore(self.max_concurrent)  # Limit concurrent tasks\n\n        async def bound_task(task: AsyncTask):\n            async with sem:\n                return await self._run_task(task)\n\n        task_coroutines = [bound_task(task) for task in tasks]\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*task_coroutines)\n\n        return results\n\n# Example coroutine tasks\nasync def sample_coroutine_task(id: int) -> int:\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulating I/O-bound work\n    return id * id\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    task_manager = AsyncTaskManager(max_concurrent=4)\n    tasks = [AsyncTask(sample_coroutine_task, i) for i in range(10)]\n\n    results = asyncio.run(task_manager.execute(tasks))\n\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **AsyncTask Class**: Similar to the previous version, this class represents a task with a coroutine, arguments, and keyword arguments.\n\n2. **AsyncTaskManager Class**: Manages the execution of asynchronous tasks:\n   - The `__init__` method accepts a `max_concurrent` parameter to control concurrency.\n   - The `_run_task` method is an internal method that `await`s the execution of the task\u2019s function.\n   - The `execute` method runs the tasks using `asyncio.gather` and limits concurrency with a semaphore.\n\n### How It Works:\n- The tasks are represented as `AsyncTask` instances.\n- To run the tasks, you create an `AsyncTaskManager` and call the `execute` method with a list of tasks.\n- `asyncio.gather` is used to run the tasks concurrently, allowing for efficient use of I/O-bound functions.\n\n### Advantages:\n- Great for I/O-bound tasks such as network calls or file operations, as it handles context switching efficiently.\n- Uses asynchronous programming principles, which can lead to more readable and maintainable code in I/O-heavy applications.\n\n### Usage:\n- Similar to the previous version, just instantiate the `AsyncTaskManager`, create your tasks using `AsyncTask`, and call the `execute` method.\n- The `asyncio.run()` function handles the asynchronous event loop.\n\nThis implementation can also be extended to handle error management, timeouts, or task cancellations, depending on your project's needs!",

This approach is beneficial when you need to perform heavy computations that can be parallelized.\n\n### Parallel Task Processing Library Using Multiprocessing\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the Parallel Task Processor.\n\n        :param max_workers: The maximum number of processes to use.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult:\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a task to be executed.\n\n        :param func: The function to execute.\n        :param args: The positional arguments to pass to the function.\n        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments to pass to the function.\n        :return: An AsyncResult object representing the execution of the task.\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(func, args=args, kwds=kwargs)\n\n    def submit_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable], *args, **kwargs) -> List[multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a list of tasks to be executed.\n\n        :param tasks: A list of functions to execute.\n        :param args: The positional arguments to pass to the functions.\n        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments to pass to the functions.\n        :return: A list of AsyncResult objects representing the execution of the tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        results = [self.submit_task(task, *args, **kwargs) for task in tasks]\n        return results\n\n    def wait_for_results(self, results: List[multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult], timeout: float = None) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Wait for the results of the submitted tasks.\n\n        :param results: The AsyncResult objects to wait for.\n        :param timeout: Optional timeout for waiting.\n        :return: A list of results from the completed tasks.\n        \"\"\"\n        return [result.get(timeout=timeout) for result in results]\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Shutdown the worker pool.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n# Example function to be run in parallel\ndef example_task(n: int) -> int:\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n    return n * n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create an instance of the ParallelTaskProcessor\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # List of tasks to be executed\n    tasks = [example_task for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Submit tasks and get results\n    results = processor.submit_tasks(tasks, 5)\n\n    # Wait for results from all tasks\n    final_results = processor.wait_for_results(results)\n\n    print(\"Results:\", final_results)\n\n    # Clean up the worker pool\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes a pool of worker processes using `multiprocessing.Pool`. You can specify the `max_workers`; if not provided, it defaults to the number of CPU cores.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: \n   - The `submit_task` method submits a single task to the pool, returning an `AsyncResult` object.\n   - The `submit_tasks` method allows submitting multiple tasks and returns a list of `AsyncResult` objects.\n\n3. **Result Retrieval**: The `wait_for_results` method retrieves the results from the `AsyncResult` objects, utilizing the `get()` method to block until results are available.\n\n4. **Pool Shutdown**: The `shutdown` method gracefully closes and joins the worker pool, ensuring that all processes finish execution.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: In the main block, the library is demonstrated by submitting example tasks and retrieving their results.\n\n### Advantages and Considerations\n- This implementation is better suited for CPU-bound tasks as it utilizes multiple processes, allowing them to run in parallel on separate CPU cores, unlike threads which may be limited by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n- You may want to implement error handling in production code to deal with exceptions raised within the tasks.\n\nThis multiprocessing-based library is foundational and can be extended with additional features like task prioritization, fault tolerance, and monitoring capabilities!",
        "Certainly! Here's another implementation for a high-performance parallel task processing library using Python, but this time we'll incorporate an event-driven design with the `asyncio` library. This will allow for efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks and enable more extensive concurrency.\n\n### Asynchronous Task Processing Library\n\n1. **Library Structure**: We\u2019ll define an `AsyncTaskManager` class that facilitates asynchronous task submission and execution.\n2. **Async/Await Pattern**: We'll utilize the async and await keywords for concurrency.\n3. **Task Management**: We\u2019ll handle the submission and execution of tasks in a non-blocking manner.\n\n### Initial Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Callable, Any, List\n\nclass AsyncTaskManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the AsyncTaskManager.\"\"\"\n        self.tasks = []\n\n    async def submit(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"\n        Submit a function to be executed with the given arguments.\n\n        :param func: The async function to execute.\n        :param args: Positional arguments for the function.\n        :param kwargs: Keyword arguments for the function.\n        :return: The result of the function execution.\n        \"\"\"\n        task = asyncio.create_task(func(*args, **kwargs))\n        self.tasks.append(task)\n        return task\n\n    async def wait_for_all(self) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Wait for all submitted tasks to complete.\n\n        :return: A list of results in the order the tasks were submitted.\n        \"\"\"\n        return await asyncio.gather(*self.tasks)\n\n    def clear_tasks(self):\n        \"\"\"Clear the list of submitted tasks.\"\"\"\n        self.tasks.clear()\n\n# Example usage\nasync def sample_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A sample async task that simulates a time-consuming operation.\"\"\"\n    await asyncio.sleep(n)  # Simulate an async operation\n    return f\"Completed task for {n} seconds\"\n\nasync def main():\n    task_manager = AsyncTaskManager()\n\n    # Submit tasks\n    tasks = [task_manager.submit(sample_task, i) for i in range(1, 6)]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and retrieve results\n    results = await task_manager.wait_for_all()\n\n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    # Clear tasks if needed\n    task_manager.clear_tasks()\n\n# Entry point for the asynchronous event loop\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **AsyncTaskManager Class**:\n   - Initializes an empty list to store tasks.\n   - The `submit` method allows the submission of asynchronous functions that return a task.\n   - The `wait_for_all` method gathers results from all the submitted tasks concurrently.\n\n2. **Sample Async Task**:\n   - `sample_task` simulates an I/O-bound operation with `await asyncio.sleep()` to mimic asynchronous behavior.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - The `main` function demonstrates how to create an instance of `AsyncTaskManager`, submit tasks, wait for their completion, and print results.\n   - The `asyncio.run(main())` is the entry point for running the asynchronous event loop.\n\n### Considerations:\n- This asynchronous design is particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks (like network requests) where you want to maximize concurrency.\n- For CPU-bound tasks, using `asyncio` might not be as beneficial; in such cases, consider using a library based on threading or multiprocessing.\n- Enhancements for production use could include error handling, cancellation of individual tasks, a logging mechanism, and performance monitoring.",
        "Certainly! Below is an alternative implementation of a high-performance parallel task processing library using Python's `multiprocessing` module. This version focuses on distributing tasks across multiple processes, which can be beneficial for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n### Example Code Using `multiprocessing`\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\" Submits a task to the processing pool. \"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(func, args, kwargs)\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, tasks):\n        \"\"\" Wait for all submitted tasks to complete and return results. \"\"\"\n        results = []\n        for task in tasks:\n            try:\n                result = task.get()  # Blocking call to get the result\n                results.append(result)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Task generated an exception: {e}\")\n        return results\n\n    def close(self):\n        \"\"\" Close the pool and wait for work to finish. \"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\ndef example_task(n):\n    \"\"\" A sample task that computes the square of a number after a delay. \"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a time-consuming task\n    return n * n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    tasks = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        task = processor.submit_task(example_task, i)\n        tasks.append(task)\n\n    results = processor.wait_for_completion(tasks)\n    processor.close()\n\n    print(\"Processed Results:\", results)\n```\n\n### Breakdown of the Code\n\n1. **ParallelTaskProcessor Class:**\n   - Initializes a multiprocessing pool with the specified number of worker processes (defaulting to the number of CPU cores).\n\n2. **submit_task Method:**\n   - Uses `apply_async` to submit a task to the pool asynchronously. It returns a `AsyncResult` object that can be used to access the result later.\n\n3. **wait_for_completion Method:**\n   - Takes a list of tasks and blocks until each task completes. It collects results and handles exceptions.\n\n4. **close Method:**\n   - Closes the pool, ensuring that no more tasks can be submitted, and waits for the worker processes to finish.\n\n5. **example_task Function:**\n   - Similar to the previous example, this function simulates a time-consuming computation by squaring a number after a sleep.\n\n### Usage\nThis code provides a robust framework for parallel execution using processes, which can be more effective for CPU-intensive tasks. To use this library, simply replace `example_task` with your desired function for parallel execution.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** If your tasks need to exchange data, look into shared memory or multiprocessing queues.\n- **Serialization:** Each task's input must be serializable because of how `multiprocessing` works (it uses pickling).\n- **Performance and Overhead:** Note that spawning new processes involves some overhead. For lightweight tasks, using threads might be more efficient.\n- **Error Handling:** Like the previous version, enhance exception handling and logging for better robustness in production systems.\n\n### When to Use\n- This implementation is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks, such as data processing or mathematical computations, where you want to make full use of your CPU cores.",
        "Certainly! Another approach to creating a high-performance parallel task processing library is to implement it using Python's `asyncio` module, which is well-suited for asynchronous programming, especially for I/O-bound tasks. Below is a simple implementation that showcases how to manage and execute tasks concurrently using asynchronous features.\n\n### Asyncio-based Parallel Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom typing import Callable, List, Any\n\nclass AsyncTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the async task processor.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    async def _run_task(self, task: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"Run a single task asynchronously.\"\"\"\n        return await task(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    async def execute_tasks(self, tasks: List[Callable], *args, **kwargs) -> List[Any]:\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of tasks concurrently.\"\"\"\n        results = []\n        task_coros = [self._run_task(task, *args, **kwargs) for task in tasks]\n        \n        # Gather results from all tasks\n        return await asyncio.gather(*task_coros)\n\nasync def task_example(x):\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate a batch job with a non-blocking delay\n    return x * x\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = AsyncTaskProcessor()\n\n    tasks = [task_example] * 10  # Create a list of tasks\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    \n    results = loop.run_until_complete(processor.execute_tasks(tasks, 10))\n    \n    print('Results:', results)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code Components\n\n1. **Class `AsyncTaskProcessor`**:\n   - This class serves as the main interface for executing tasks asynchronously.\n\n2. **Method `_run_task`**:\n   - A private asynchronous method that wraps the execution of individual tasks.\n\n3. **Method `execute_tasks`**:\n   - Collects coroutines for each task and runs them concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.\n\n4. **Example Task `task_example`**:\n   - An asynchronous function that simulates an I/O-bound operation (sleeping for 1 second) and returns the square of the input.\n\n5. **Main block**:\n   - Instantiates the task processor, defines tasks, executes them using the asyncio event loop, and prints the results.\n\n### Usage\nJust like the previous example, this asynchronous version is designed to handle tasks that are primarily I/O-bound, making it suitable for tasks like web scraping, network requests, or other operations involving waiting for external resources.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n1. **Optimal for I/O-bound tasks**: This method leverages asynchronous programming, which is efficient for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations.\n\n2. **Event Loop Management**: Users need to manage the asyncio event loop properly, which can be less straightforward than using a thread or process pool.\n\n3. **Granularity of Tasks**: Grouping or batching I/O operations could level up efficiency further.\n\nBy using the `asyncio` module, you can build a robust architecture for parallel task processing that is especially efficient for tasks involving waiting or blocking operations. Feel free to extend this library for more advanced use cases such as custom error handling, timeouts, or cancellation of tasks.",
        "Certainly! Here's an alternative approach using the `multiprocessing` module in Python for better CPU-bound task processing. This library uses processes instead of threads, which can lead to better performance in CPU-bound tasks due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation in Python.\n\n### Parallel Task Processor Using `multiprocessing`\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\nimport queue\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.tasks_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n        self.results_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n    def submit(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to the queue.\"\"\"\n        self.tasks_queue.put((func, args, kwargs))\n\n    def _worker(self):\n        \"\"\"Worker function that processes tasks from the queue.\"\"\"\n        while True:\n            try:\n                func, args, kwargs = self.tasks_queue.get(timeout=1)  # Adjust timeout as needed\n                if func is None:  # Sentinel value to exit the worker\n                    break\n                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n                self.results_queue.put(result)\n            except queue.Empty:\n                break\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Task execution failed: {e}\")\n\n    def start(self):\n        \"\"\"Start processing tasks in parallel.\"\"\"\n        processes = []\n        \n        for _ in range(self.max_workers):\n            process = multiprocessing.Process(target=self._worker)\n            process.start()\n            processes.append(process)\n\n        # Wait for all tasks to complete\n        self.tasks_queue.join()\n\n        # Send sentinel values to terminate the workers\n        for _ in processes:\n            self.tasks_queue.put((None, None, None))\n\n        for process in processes:\n            process.join()\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the processor.\"\"\"\n        self.tasks_queue.close()\n        self.results_queue.close()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    def example_task(n):\n        \"\"\"A simple task that simulates work.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"Task {n} is starting.\")\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulating a long computation\n        result = f\"Task {n} is done.\"\n        print(result)\n        return result\n\n    processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit tasks\n    for i in range(10):\n        processor.submit(example_task, i)\n\n    # Start processing tasks\n    processor.start()\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Key Features of This Implementation:\n\n1. **Multiprocessing**: Uses processes instead of threads to sidestep the GIL, making it more suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: The `submit` method allows users to enqueue tasks.\n\n3. **Worker Method**: The `_worker` method retrieves tasks, executes them, and stores their results in a separate queue.\n\n4. **Start Method**: Initiates multiple worker processes.\n\n5. **Shutdown Method**: Closes the queues and waits for all processes to finish executing.\n\n6. **Sentinel Values**: Uses sentinel values (`None`) to signal worker processes to exit gracefully.\n\n### Benefits of This Approach:\n\n- Better performance for CPU-bound tasks due to the use of separate processes.\n- Ability to scale according to the number of CPU cores available.\n- Simplicity in managing tasks using a multiprocessing queue system.\n\n### Features to Consider for Expansion:\n\n- **Result Collection**: Provide a method for fetching results from the `results_queue`.\n- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implement methods to adjust the number of worker processes dynamically.\n- **Worker Feedback**: Design a mechanism to report the status of ongoing tasks.\n- **Task Prioritization**: Explore priority queues for initiating critical tasks first.\n\nThis version offers a solid foundation for a parallel task processing library that can handle intensive CPU workloads efficiently.",

If none is specified, it defaults to the number of available CPU cores.\n\n2. **Task Submission**: \n   - The `submit` method submits a single task for execution and returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be used to retrieve the result later.\n   - The `map` method applies a given function to all items in an iterable, returning a list of results.\n\n3. **Close**: The `close` method shuts down the pool to new tasks and waits for current tasks to complete.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The example shows how to use both `submit` and `map`. Results can be retrieved using the `get()` method on `AsyncResult` objects.\n\n### Benefits and Considerations\n- **Multiprocessing**: Suitable for CPU-bound workloads since each process runs in its own memory space. This avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation found in CPython.\n- **Inter-Process Communication**: If tasks need to share data, consider using `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Manager`.\n- **Overhead**: Be aware that creating processes has more overhead than threads, so this approach is preferable for heavier tasks that can benefit from parallel execution.\n\nThis alternative implementation provides a robust approach for executing parallel tasks in a truly concurrent manner, making it suitable for CPU-intensive applications.",

This implementation will focus on a more flexible and robust task management approach.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Library Structure\n\n1. **Directory Layout:**\n   ```\n   parallel_task_processor_v2/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 processor.py\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 examples/\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 demo.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Basic Code Implementation:**\n\n#### `__init__.py`\nThis keeps the directory as a package.\n\n```python\n# parallel_task_processor_v2/__init__.py\nfrom .processor import MultiprocessingTaskProcessor\n```\n\n#### `processor.py`\nThis file implements the task processor using the multiprocessing library.\n\n```python\n# parallel_task_processor_v2/processor.py\n\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool, Manager\nimport time\nimport itertools\n\nclass MultiprocessingTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.manager = Manager()\n        self.results = self.manager.list()  # Use shared list to capture results\n\n    def _worker(self, func, args):\n        \"\"\"Defines the worker method for the pool.\"\"\"\n        result = func(*args)\n        self.results.append(result)\n        return result\n\n    def submit(self, func, *args):\n        \"\"\"Submit a task to the worker pool.\"\"\"\n        with Pool(processes=self.max_workers) as pool:\n            return pool.apply_async(self._worker, (func, args))\n\n    def gather_results(self, async_results):\n        \"\"\"Collect results from async_results.\"\"\"\n        results = []\n        for result in async_results:\n            results.append(result.get())  # Wait for each task to complete\n        return results\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"No explicit shutdown is needed for Pool as context manager handles it.\"\"\"\n        pass\n```\n\n### Step 2: Example Usage\n\n#### `demo.py`\nHere\u2019s an example of how to use the updated library.\n\n```python\n# parallel_task_processor_v2/examples/demo.py\n\nfrom parallel_task_processor_v2 import MultiprocessingTaskProcessor\nimport time\n\ndef sample_task(n):\n    \"\"\"A sample task that simulates a time-consuming computation.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(n)\n    return f\"Task completed in {n} seconds.\"\n\ndef main():\n    processor = MultiprocessingTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit tasks\n    tasks = [processor.submit(sample_task, i) for i in range(1, 6)]\n\n    # Gather results\n    results = processor.gather_results(tasks)\n\n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n    # Shutdown (not strictly needed in this version)\n    processor.shutdown()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Features of This Implementation\n\n1. **Multiprocessing Model:** Utilizes the `multiprocessing` library to achieve parallelism, taking full advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n2. **Shared Memory:** Uses a `Manager` to maintain a shared results list, allowing the worker processes to store results directly.\n3. **Asynchronous Task Submission:** The library submits tasks asynchronously and handles their completion with `apply_async`.\n4. **Robustness:** Handles multiple types of input with flexibility.\n\n### Future Improvements\n\nTo enhance the functionality further, you could consider adding:\n\n- Task cancellation mechanisms.\n- Support for input validation and error handling.\n- More sophisticated task dependencies management.\n- Dynamic worker pooling that adjusts based on the workload.\n\nThis implementation provides a robust base for building parallel processing capabilities while leveraging Python's multiprocessing features. You can adapt and expand upon it based on your specific requirements!",
        "Certainly! Below is an alternative implementation of a high-performance parallel task processing library using Python, this time leveraging the `multiprocessing` module. This approach allows for parallel execution across multiple processes, which can be beneficial for CPU-bound tasks.\n\n### Multiprocessing Task Processing Library\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\n\n\nclass Task:\n    def __init__(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.func = func\n        self.args = args\n        self.kwargs = kwargs\n    \n    def execute(self):\n        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)\n\n\nclass TaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def add_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\n        task = Task(func, *args, **kwargs)\n        return self.pool.apply_async(task.execute)\n\n    def process_tasks(self, tasks):\n        results = []\n        for task in tasks:\n            results.append(task.get())\n        \n        for idx, result in enumerate(results):\n            print(f'Task {idx} completed with result: {result}')\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n\n# Example Tasks\ndef sample_task(x, y):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulating long-running task\n    return x + y\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = TaskProcessor(max_workers=5)\n\n    # Collect tasks\n    futures = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        future = processor.add_task(sample_task, i, i + 1)\n        futures.append(future)\n\n    # Process tasks\n    processor.process_tasks(futures)\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Overview of the Code:\n\n1. **Task Class**:\n    - Similar to the previous example, it allows wrapping functions and their arguments.\n\n2. **TaskProcessor Class**:\n    - Initializes a `multiprocessing.Pool`. This manages multiple processes that can run tasks in parallel.\n    - The `add_task` method creates a `Task`, executes it asynchronously with `apply_async`, and returns a `AsyncResult` object.\n    - The `process_tasks` method retrieves results from the completed tasks.\n    - The `shutdown` method closes the pool and waits for the worker processes to finish.\n\n3. **Task Example**: The `sample_task` function performs a basic workload\u2014summing the arguments with a simulated delay.\n\n### Usage:\n\nThe usage remains similar to the previous version: instantiate the `TaskProcessor`, add tasks, process the results, and finally shut down.\n\n### Key Differences from the First Implementation:\n\n- **Multiprocessing vs. Threading**:\n   - This implementation uses the `multiprocessing` library, suitable for CPU-bound tasks that benefit from running in separate processes.\n   - Thread-based execution is often constrained by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), making multiprocessing a better choice for CPU-bound workloads.\n\nThis library can be extended with functionalities like task cancellation, handling exceptions more gracefully, or logging progress and results. You can tailor it to specific requirements based on your workload characteristics!",
        "Certainly! Below is an alternative implementation of a high-performance parallel task processing library using Python's `multiprocessing` module. This version is particularly well-suited for CPU-bound tasks, as it uses separate processes to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). \n\n### High-Performance Parallel Task Processing Library (Multiprocessing Version)\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\n\nclass ParallelTaskProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):\n        self.max_workers = max_workers or multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n        self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=self.max_workers)\n\n    def submit_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Submit a new task to the process pool.\"\"\"\n        return self.pool.apply_async(fn, args, kwargs)\n\n    def wait_for_completion(self, async_results):\n        \"\"\"Wait for all tasks to complete and collect results.\"\"\"\n        results = []\n        for async_result in async_results:\n            try:\n                result = async_result.get()  # This will block until the result is available\n                results.append(result)\n            except Exception as e:\n                results.append(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return results\n\n    def shutdown(self):\n        \"\"\"Shutdown the process pool gracefully.\"\"\"\n        self.pool.close()\n        self.pool.join()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    def example_task(seconds):\n        time.sleep(seconds)\n        return f\"Completed after {seconds} seconds\"\n\n    task_processor = ParallelTaskProcessor(max_workers=4)\n\n    # Submit some tasks\n    async_results = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        async_results.append(task_processor.submit_task(example_task, i + 1))\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and collect results\n    results = task_processor.wait_for_completion(async_results)\n\n    # Print results\n    for r in results:\n        print(r)\n\n    # Shutdown the processor\n    task_processor.shutdown()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n   - Initializes a `multiprocessing.Pool` with a specified number of worker processes. The default is the number of CPU cores available.\n\n2. **Submit Task (`submit_task`)**:\n   - Submits a new task to the pool and returns an `AsyncResult` object, which can be used to retrieve the result later.\n\n3. **Wait for Completion (`wait_for_completion`)**:\n   - Waits for all submitted tasks to complete by calling `get()` on each `AsyncResult`. This method blocks until the respective result is ready.\n\n4. **Shutdown (`shutdown`)**:\n   - Safely shuts down the process pool by closing it and waiting for the worker processes to exit.\n\n### Example Usage\n- Similar to the previous example, the `example_task` simulates work by sleeping for a specified number of seconds.\n- The script submits multiple tasks and collects the results once all tasks are completed.\n\n### Considerations\n- This implementation is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks, as it takes advantage of multiprocessing to utilize multiple CPU cores.\n- Error handling is also simplified; you may implement specific needs based on your application's requirements.\n- Note that multiprocessing may introduce overhead due to inter-process communication, so it's most effective for tasks requiring significant computation rather than lightweight tasks.\n\n### Summary\nThis implementation provides a solid option for handling CPU-bound processes efficiently, utilizing Python's `multiprocessing` capabilities. You can extend this library further by implementing more advanced features like priority processing or dynamic worker allocation based on workload.",

You can expand upon this structure based on your specific requirements.",
        "Certainly! Here's an alternative implementation of a high-performance parallel task processing library, this time using Python's `asyncio` library for asynchronous programming.
