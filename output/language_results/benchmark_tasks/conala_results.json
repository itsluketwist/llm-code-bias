            "To print a Unicode string in Python, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```\n# Define a Unicode string\ntext = \"Hello, \u4f60\u597d, \u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947\"\n\n# Print the Unicode string\nprint(text)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. Define a variable `text` and assign it a Unicode string. Unicode strings can contain characters from multiple languages, including non-Latin scripts like Chinese or Hindi.\n2. Using the `print()` function, simply print the Unicode string to the console. Python supports Unicode natively, so you can print Unicode strings without needing any special setup or encoding handling.\n\nWhen you run this code snippet, the Unicode string `\"Hello, \u4f60\u597d, \u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947\"` will be displayed in the console, showing the text correctly in various languages."
